  <p><strong>(a)</strong> Right-hand continuity:

  \quad x \to x_0^+.

  <p><strong>(a) Function set:</strong> Any set of functions, e.g., \( \{f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\} \).</p>

  <p><strong>(d) Functions as vectors:</strong> Yes, functions can be considered vectors if defined so, because the elements only need to satisfy the vector space operations (addition and scalar multiplication) and axioms.</p>

<h2> 5: Proper functions, well-defined functions, and arbitrary assignments</h2>

<p>
<strong>Proper function:</strong><br>
A proper function \( f: X \to Y \) assigns exactly one element of \( Y \) to each element of the domain \( X \). It can be one-to-one or many-to-one. <strong>Note:</strong> a proper function might not be well-defined if the rule is ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
Explain the following concepts in your own words:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(a) Arbitrary assignment.</strong><br>
What is an arbitrary assignment?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(b) Well-defined function.</strong><br>
Explain what it means for a function to be well-defined.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(c) Why must every element of the domain have an image in a well-defined function?</strong>
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your reasoning here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proper function:</strong>  A proper function \( f: X \to Y \) is a relation from \( X \) to \( Y \) such that
  \[
  \forall x \in X, \exists! \, y \in Y \text{ s.t. } (x, y) \in f
  \]
  (i.e., each input has exactly one output). It can be one-to-one or many-to-one. 
  Note: a proper function might still be <strong>ambiguous</strong> if the rule defining it is inconsistent.</p>


  <p><strong>(a) Arbitrary assignment:</strong> An arbitrary assignment assigns outputs to elements of a set without necessarily obeying the rules of a well-defined function. It can be one-to-one, many-to-one, or leave some domain elements without outputs, but it cannot assign multiple outputs to the same input (one-to-many) if it were to be a proper function.</p>

  <p><strong>(b) Well-defined function:</strong> A function \( f: X \to Y \) is well-defined if
\[
\forall x \in X, \ f(x) \text{ is uniquely determined and belongs to } Y.
\]
Ambiguity occurs if there exists any \( x \in X \) for which \( f(x) \) is not uniquely determined.  
<strong>Observation:</strong> <em>Being ambiguous is logically equivalent to being not well-defined</em>.
</p>
  <p><strong>(c) Why every domain element must have an image:</strong> If any domain element had no image, the assignment would be incomplete or ambiguous. A well-defined function must assign exactly one output to each domain element.</p>

<h2> 6: Correspondence, equivalence, and equality of functions</h2>

<p>
Explain the following concepts in your own words and give examples if possible:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(a) Correspondence.</strong><br>
Define what it means for a function to be viewed as a correspondence.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(b) Equivalence of functions.</strong><br>
Define when two functions are considered equivalent. How does this relate to everyday use of the word “equivalent”?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(c) Equality of functions.</strong><br>
Define when two functions are equal. How is this related to equivalence?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Correspondence:</strong><br>
  A correspondence is a set of ordered pairs \( (x, y) \) with \( x \in X \) and \( y \in Y \).  
  A function can be rigorously viewed as a correspondence in which each input \( x \in X \) appears in exactly one pair.  
  This formalises the input-output relationship without necessarily specifying a formula or rule.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(b) Equivalence of functions:</strong><br>
  Two functions \( f, g: X \to Y \) are considered equivalent if
  \[
  \forall x \in X, \ f(x) = g(x).
  \]
  - This is the **mathematical definition**: outputs match for all inputs.  
  - In everyday language, “equivalent” can just mean “similar” or “interchangeable,” but in math it is **strict and precise**.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(c) Equality of functions:</strong><br>
  Two functions \( f, g: X \to Y \) are equal if their **correspondences (sets of ordered pairs) are identical**:
  \[
  f = g \quad \iff \quad \forall x \in X, \ f(x) = g(x).
  \]  
  Notice: for functions, **equality coincides with mathematical equivalence**, but equality emphasises the set-of-pairs perspective.
  </p>

<h2> 7: Topology and Metrisability</h2>

<p>
Suppose we have elements in a vector space or a function space.  
<strong> (a):</strong> Why do we impose a topology on these elements?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong> (b):</strong> Define metrisable (metrisiable) rigorously.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Why impose a topology?</strong><br>
  We impose a topology on elements of vector or function spaces to define notions of **closeness, limits, continuity, and convergence**.  
  Topology formalises which elements are "near" each other without necessarily using numbers.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(b) Definition of metrisable space:</strong><br>
  A topological space \( (X, \mathcal{T}) \) is <strong>metrisable</strong> if there exists a metric \( d: X \times X \to [0, \infty) \) such that the topology induced by \( d \) is exactly \( \mathcal{T} \).  
  Formally:
  \[
  \mathcal{T} = \{ U \subseteq X \mid \forall x \in U, \exists \varepsilon > 0 \text{ s.t. } B_d(x, \varepsilon) \subseteq U \},
  \]
  where \( B_d(x, \varepsilon) = \{ y \in X \mid d(x, y) < \varepsilon \} \) is the open ball of radius \( \varepsilon \) around \( x \).  
  In words: a space is metrisable if we can assign a distance function such that "closeness" and "open sets" in the topology are exactly described by that metric.
  </p>

<h3>Key Point: Vectors as functions</h3>

<p>
If an element is both a vector and a function, we can describe a **finite vector** in \( \mathbb{R}^n \), say \((y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n)\), as a function
\[
f: \{1, 2, \dots, n\} \to \mathbb{R}
\]
where \( f(i) = y_i \). This gives the list of components that form the vector.  
</p>

<p>
For finite vectors, this function viewpoint is **possible but not necessary**.  
For **infinite-dimensional vectors**, the domain (index set) is infinite, e.g., \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \), and so the **function understanding becomes essential** for analysis.
</p>

<p>
This concept explains why function-based perspectives are fundamental in functional analysis, especially for infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>













<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Sequences, infinite-dimensional vectors, and functional perspective</h3>

<p>
A <strong>sequence</strong> is an infinite list of elements indexed by the natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \).  
Even if the outputs are simple, like \(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, \dots\), there are infinitely many values.  
</p>

<p>
A sequence can describe an <strong>infinite-dimensional vector</strong>, where each element of the sequence corresponds to a component of the vector.  
</p>

<p>
The <strong>sequence space</strong> is the set of different sequences. Each sequence is infinite and describes a single vector.  
</p>

<p>
To construct an infinite-dimensional vector, we need an infinite set of basis components.  
- If we have a vector that is "one-to-one," only one basis vector is needed to describe that vector.  
- To describe all vectors in an infinite-dimensional vector space, we require **infinitely many basis vectors**.  
</p>

<p>
Remember: these vectors can also be viewed as **functions**, where the domain is the index set (natural numbers) and the output is the component value. This is why **functional understanding is essential** in infinite-dimensional vector spaces.
</p>

















<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Norms, metrics, and infinite-dimensional vectors/functions</h3>

<p>
In finite-dimensional vector spaces, we often talk about **weights, lengths, distances, and angles** between vectors. In many manifolds or abstract spaces, we want the same: to measure **distances and angles** between vectors or functions.  
</p>

<p>
A <strong>norm</strong> is a function that assigns a size (length) to each vector or function:
\[
\|\cdot\| : V \to [0, \infty)
\]
and satisfies positive definiteness, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality.  
</p>

<p>
A norm induces a <strong>metric</strong> via
\[
d(u,v) = \|u-v\|.
\]
This metric tells us the "distance" between any two elements.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why not just define a metric directly?</strong><br>
- A metric measures distances, but does not automatically give you **lengths, scaling, or angles**.  
- A norm gives **more structure**: it tells you both the size of individual elements and induces a metric for distances.  
- Especially in infinite-dimensional spaces (e.g., sequences, function spaces), using a norm allows you to talk rigorously about:
  <ul>
    <li>Distances between elements</li>
    <li>Cauchy sequences and convergence</li>
    <li>Completeness of the space</li>
    <li>Linear structure (scaling and addition of vectors/functions)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
So, the norm is more than just a metric: it preserves the **linear and functional structure** of the space while giving a natural metric to define limits, convergence, and continuity.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Key distinction:</strong><br>
- In **functional analysis / infinite-dimensional vector spaces**, we use norms because we need both **linear structure and distance**.  
- In **general relativity / manifolds**, the space is **not a vector space**, so we only need a **metric tensor** to measure distances and angles; a separate norm is unnecessary.  
</p>













<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Closed subspaces and Cauchy sequences</h3>

<p>
A subset \(M \subset V\) of a normed space \(V\) is <strong>closed</strong> if it contains all its limit points:
\[
\text{If } (x_n) \subset M \text{ and } x_n \to x \text{ in } V, \text{ then } x \in M.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why closedness matters:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In infinite-dimensional spaces, the <strong>image of a linear map</strong> may not be closed, even if the map is linear and bounded.</li>
  <li>If the image is not closed, a **Cauchy sequence in the image may converge to a limit outside the image**, breaking convergence within the subspace.</li>
  <li>Closedness ensures that **limits of Cauchy sequences stay in the subspace**, which is essential for completeness and functional analysis constructions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Closedness = all limit points included. Necessary so that Cauchy sequences in a subspace converge **inside** the subspace, especially in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>









<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Completeness, norms, and convergence in normed spaces</h3>

<p>
A normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) is <strong>complete</strong> if <strong>every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a limit in the space</strong>.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Norm and distance:</strong><br>
- A norm assigns a size (length, or "weight") to each element, even if the element is an infinite-dimensional vector or a function.  
- The norm induces a metric:
\[
d(u,v) = \|u-v\|,
\]
which allows us to measure the distance between elements in a precise way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cauchy sequences:</strong><br>
- A Cauchy sequence \((v_n)\) satisfies:
\[
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ s.t. } \|v_n - v_m\| < \varepsilon \quad \forall n,m \ge N
\]
- Not every sequence is Cauchy, but in a **complete normed space**, every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit within the space.  
- The norm ensures that the "size" of differences between sequence elements is measurable, so we can meaningfully talk about convergence, even for infinite-dimensional elements.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important note on finiteness:</strong><br>
- The norm gives the "weight" of an element, but it does <em>not</em> guarantee the space is bounded; elements can have arbitrarily large norm.  
- What matters for convergence is that the sequence is Cauchy — distances between elements shrink — not that individual elements have finite norm.
</p>









<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Complete normed spaces (Banach spaces)</h3>

<p>
A <strong>complete normed space</strong>, also called a <strong>Banach space</strong>, is a normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) in which <strong>every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit within the space</strong>.
</p>

<p>
- The norm defines weights of each element and then the distances between elements: \(d(u,v) = \|u-v\|\).  
- Cauchy sequences are sequences whose elements get arbitrarily close.  
- Completeness ensures that these sequences have limits that stay in the space, making convergence meaningful even for infinite-dimensional elements.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Complete normed space = “all Cauchy sequences converge inside the space.”
</p>










<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Inner product and Hilbert spaces</h3>

<p>
- A <strong>norm</strong> gives the size (length) of vectors/functions, but it does not define angles.  
- To define **angles, orthogonality, and projections**, we use an <strong>inner product</strong>:
\[
\langle u, v \rangle
\]  
which satisfies linearity, symmetry (or conjugate symmetry), and positive-definiteness.
</p>

<p>
- A **Hilbert space** is a complete normed space in which the norm is induced by an inner product:
\[
\|v\| = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle}.
\]
- This allows us to rigorously define **lengths, angles, orthogonality, and projections** in infinite-dimensional spaces.
A manifold is able to define the weight of a vector, and distances and angles between other vectors, solely using the metric. For infinite-dimensional spaces, we use the norm and inner product.
</p>




<h2> 9: Projection onto a subspace</h2>

<p>
Define the projection of a vector or function onto a subspace. Give the key properties and intuition.
</p>

<textarea rows="4" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong> The <strong>projection</strong> of a vector or function \(x\) onto a subspace \(M\) is the element \(y \in M\) such that the difference \(x - y\) is orthogonal to \(M\).  
  </p>

  <p>
  Formally, let \(H\) be a Hilbert space and \(M \subset H\) a subspace. For every \(x \in H\), the projection of \(x\) onto \(M\) is the unique \(y \in M\) such that:
  \[
  x - y \perp M
  \]
  That is, \(\langle x - y, z \rangle = 0\) for all \(z \in M\).
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Intuition:</strong> \(y\) is the closest point in \(M\) to \(x\), so the projection “drops” \(x\) onto the subspace along the shortest path.
  </p>
</details>










<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Banach function spaces</h3>

<p>
A <strong>Banach function space</strong> is a function space that is also a <strong>complete normed space</strong>. That is, it consists of functions with certain properties, equipped with a norm, such that every Cauchy sequence of functions converges to a function in the space.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>C([a,b])</strong>: the space of all continuous functions on the interval [a,b], with the supremum norm \(\|f\|_\infty = \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)|\).</li>
  <li><strong>L<sup>p</sup>([a,b])</strong>: the space of Lebesgue p-integrable functions \(f\) such that
    \(\int_a^b |f(x)|^p dx < \infty\), with norm \(\|f\|_p = \left(\int_a^b |f(x)|^p dx\right)^{1/p}\).</li>
  <li><strong>l<sup>p</sup></strong>: the space of sequences \((y_1, y_2, \dots)\) such that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty |y_n|^p < \infty\). These sequences often represent the outputs of functions in a discretised sense.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Banach function spaces combine **function-specific properties** (like continuity or integrability) with **completeness under a norm**, allowing rigorous analysis of convergence and limits in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>










<h2> 10: Lebesgue function spaces L<sup>p</sup>(Ω)</h2>

<p>
Define the space L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) and explain the role of p and Ω. Discuss why infinite independent functions exist in this space and how indicator functions illustrate linear independence.
</p>

<textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  The Lebesgue space L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) consists of all functions \(f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)) such that
  \[
  \int_\Omega |f(x)|^p dx < \infty.
  \]
  Here:
  <ul>
    <li>\(\Omega\) is the domain of the functions (can be an interval, a measure space, or more abstract set).</li>
    <li>p ≥ 1 indicates the exponent in the integrability condition (controls how "strongly" the function is integrable).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Infinite independent functions:</strong><br>
  - L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) contains infinitely many linearly independent functions; no finite combination of functions can generate all of L<sup>p</sup>(Ω).  
  - A standard example: the <strong>indicator functions</strong> \(1_{A_i}\) of disjoint measurable subsets \(A_i \subset \Omega\).  
  - If \(A_i\) are disjoint, the functions \(1_{A_i}\) are linearly independent, because any linear combination is zero only if all coefficients are zero.  
  - Checking linear independence often relies on overlapping or disjoint sets to see if any combination produces zero everywhere.
  </p>
</details>
















<h2> 11: Linear maps, kernel, and image</h2>

<p>
Let \(T: V \to W\) be a linear map between vector spaces. Define the kernel and image of \(T\), and explain the relationship to injectivity and surjectivity. Discuss any special considerations for infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>

<textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition of linear map:</strong><br>
  \(T: V \to W\) is linear if
  \[
  T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y), \quad T(\alpha x) = \alpha T(x), \quad \forall x,y \in V, \ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \text{ or } \mathbb{C}.
  \]
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Kernel:</strong><br>
  The kernel of \(T\) is
  \[
  \ker(T) = \{x \in V : T(x) = 0\}.
  \]
  <strong>Injectivity:</strong> \(T\) is injective if and only if \(\ker(T) = \{0\}\).
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Image (range):</strong><br>
  The image of \(T\) is
  \[
  \operatorname{im}(T) = \{T(x) : x \in V\} \subset W.
  \]
  <strong>Surjectivity:</strong> \(T\) is surjective if \(\operatorname{im}(T) = W\).  
  - In infinite-dimensional spaces, the image may **not be closed**, so surjectivity is harder to check.  
  - Continuity (or boundedness) of \(T\) is often necessary to guarantee nice properties of the image.
  </p>
</details>






<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Dual Space V*</h3>

<p>
The <strong>dual space</strong> of a vector space \(V\) over a field \(\mathbb{F}\) is the set of all <strong>linear functionals</strong> from \(V\) to \(\mathbb{F}\):
\[
V^* = \{ f : V \to \mathbb{F} \mid f \text{ is linear} \}.
\]
</p>

<p>
A <strong>linear functional</strong> \(f\) satisfies, for all \(x, y \in V\) and \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F}\):
\[
f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), \quad f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x).
\]
</p>

<p>
The dual space \(V^*\) itself is a vector space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication:
\[
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), \quad (\alpha f)(x) = \alpha f(x), \quad \forall x \in V.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Intuition:</strong> Each element of \(V^*\) “measures” vectors in \(V\) by assigning a scalar. The dual space collects all such linear measurements, providing a powerful tool in functional analysis for understanding the structure of \(V\).

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  The <strong>dual space</strong> of a vector space \(V\) over a field \(\mathbb{F}\) is
  \[
  V^* = \{ f : V \to \mathbb{F} \mid f \text{ is linear} \}.
  \]
  Elements of \(V^*\) are called <strong>linear functionals</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Infinite-dimensional case:</strong><br>
  - If \(V\) is infinite-dimensional, there exist **more linear functionals than vectors in \(V\)**.  
  - Intuition / sketch of proof:  
    1. Let \(\{e_1, e_2, \dots\}\) be a basis for \(V\).  
    2. Any sequence \((a_1, a_2, \dots)\) of scalars defines a linear functional \(f\) by
       \[
       f\Big(\sum_i x_i e_i\Big) = \sum_i a_i x_i
       \]
       which is well-defined if only finitely many \(x_i\) are non-zero (Hamel basis).  
    3. There are infinitely many choices of sequences \((a_1, a_2, \dots)\), so **dim \(V^* >\) dim \(V\)**.  
  - In contrast, in finite-dimensional spaces, \(\dim V^* = \dim V\).

<h3>Key Point: Topological Space</h3>

<p>
A <strong>topological space</strong> is a pair \((X, \tau)\) where:
<ul>
  <li>\(X\) is a set (the underlying space).</li>
  <li>\(\tau\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) called <strong>open sets</strong>, satisfying the following axioms:</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The empty set and the whole set are open: 
  \(\emptyset \in \tau\) and \(X \in \tau\).</li>
  <li>Arbitrary unions of open sets are open: 
  \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha \in \tau\) for any collection \(\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} \subset \tau\).</li>
  <li>Finite intersections of open sets are open: 
  \(\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau\) for any finite collection \(U_1, \dots, U_n \in \tau\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A topological space \((X, \tau)\) gives a notion of "openness" on \(X\), allowing us to define concepts like **continuity, convergence, connectedness, and compactness** in a general setting.
</p>




<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Metric Space</h3>

<p>
A <strong>metric space</strong> is a pair \((X, d)\) where:
<ul>
  <li>\(X\) is a set (the space of points or elements).</li>
  <li>\(d: X \times X \to [0, \infty)\) is a function called a <strong>metric</strong> or distance, satisfying the following axioms for all \(x, y, z \in X\):</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> \(d(x,y) \ge 0\), and \(d(x,y) = 0\) if and only if \(x = y\).</li>
  <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> \(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\).</li>
  <li><strong>Triangle inequality:</strong> \(d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Example: Normed spaces</strong><br>
A normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) is also a metric space with
\[
d(x,y) = \|x - y\|.
\]
This metric induces the topology of the space via open balls:
\[
B(x, r) = \{y \in V : \|x - y\| < r\}.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Metric spaces formalise the concept of distance, allowing definitions of **convergence, Cauchy sequences, continuity, and compactness** in a general setting. Norms automatically give a metric, but a metric does not necessarily come from a norm.
In Banach spaces, a metric is induced by the norm \[
d(x,y) = \|x - y\|.
\]. This does not necessarily define the angles yet for Banach - inner product needed. 
</p>

<h3>Key Point: Compactness and the unit ball in infinite-dimensional normed spaces</h3>

<p>
<strong>Compactness:</strong><br>
A subset \(K\) of a normed space \(V\) is <strong>compact</strong> if every sequence \((x_n) \subset K\) has a subsequence that converges to an element in \(K\) 
(<em>sequential compactness</em>).  
Equivalently, in topological terms, \(K\) is compact if **every open cover of \(K\) has a finite subcover**: for any collection of open sets \(\mathcal{U}\) with
\(\displaystyle K \subseteq \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal{U}} U\), there exists a finite subcollection \(U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}\) such that
\(\displaystyle K \subseteq U_1 \cup \dots \cup U_n\).
</p>



<p>
<strong>Important fact in infinite-dimensional spaces:</strong><br>
- Unlike finite-dimensional spaces, in infinite-dimensional normed spaces, a set being <strong>closed and bounded</strong> does <strong>not</strong> guarantee compactness.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Unit ball:</strong><br>
- The <strong>unit ball</strong) in a normed space \(V\) is defined as
\[
B = \{ x \in V : \|x\| \le 1 \}.
\]  
- It consists of all vectors/functions with norm ≤ 1.  
- <strong>Key point:</strong> In infinite-dimensional spaces, the unit ball is never compact.  
  - Intuition: You can always construct a sequence in the unit ball (e.g., basis vectors) with no convergent subsequence, so it fails the sequential compactness criterion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong>  
- Compact = every sequence has a convergent subsequence within the set.  
- Closed + bounded ≠ compact in infinite dimensions.  
- Unit ball is a simple example of a bounded, closed set that is **never compact**.
</p>








<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Connectedness and countability in infinite-dimensional normed spaces</h3>

<p>
<strong>Connectedness:</strong><br>
A topological space \(X\) is <strong>connected</strong> if it cannot be represented as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets.  
Equivalently, there are no two nonempty open sets \(U, V \subset X\) such that \(X = U \cup V\) and \(U \cap V = \emptyset\).  
</p>

<p>
In normed spaces (including infinite-dimensional ones), connectedness often comes from **path-connectedness**: any two points \(x, y \in X\) can be joined by a continuous path \(\gamma: [0,1] \to X\) with \(\gamma(0) = x, \gamma(1) = y\).  
- Infinite-dimensional normed spaces are typically **connected** and **path-connected**.
</p>

<p>
<strong>First-countable (1st ctb):</strong><br>
A topological space \(X\) is <strong>first-countable</strong> if each point \(x \in X\) has a **countable local base** of neighborhoods.  
- In normed spaces, the open balls \(B(x, 1/n)\), \(n = 1, 2, \dots\), form a countable local base, so **all normed spaces are first-countable**.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Second-countable (2nd ctb):</strong><br>
A space is <strong>second-countable</strong> if there exists a **countable base for the entire topology**.  
- Finite-dimensional normed spaces (like \(\mathbb{R}^n\)) are second-countable.  
- Infinite-dimensional normed spaces are generally **not second-countable**, because any base for the topology of open balls must be uncountable.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
- Connected = cannot split into two nonempty disjoint open sets.  
- Path-connected = any two points joined by a continuous path; implies connectedness.  
- 1st ctb = countable local base at each point → holds in all normed spaces.  
- 2nd ctb = countable base for the whole topology → fails in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>

<h3>Key Point: Product and Quotient Topologies</h3>

<p>
<strong>1. Product Topology:</strong><br>
Let \(\{X_i\}_{i \in I}\) be a family of topological spaces with topologies \(\tau_i\).  
The <strong>product space</strong> is 
\[
X = \prod_{i \in I} X_i = \{ (x_i)_{i \in I} : x_i \in X_i \}.
\]  
The <strong>product topology</strong> on \(X\) is the coarsest (smallest) topology that makes all projection maps
\(\pi_j : X \to X_j\), \(\pi_j((x_i)_{i \in I}) = x_j\), continuous.  

<ul>
  <li>Basis elements: finite intersections of sets of the form \(\pi_j^{-1}(U_j)\), where \(U_j \subset X_j\) is open.</li>
  <li>Intuition: Open sets in the product correspond to “all but finitely many coordinates unrestricted, finitely many coordinates constrained.”</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> \(\mathbb{R}^n = \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbb{R}\) with the usual topology is a product topology of \(n\) copies of \(\mathbb{R}\). Infinite products (e.g., sequences) use the same idea but with infinitely many coordinates.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>2. Quotient Topology:</strong><br>
Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\tau\), and let \(\sim\) be an equivalence relation on \(X\).  
The set of equivalence classes is 
\[
X / \sim = \{ [x] : x \in X \}.
\]  
The <strong>quotient topology</strong> on \(X / \sim\) is defined as the finest topology that makes the canonical projection
\(\pi: X \to X / \sim, \ \pi(x) = [x]\)
continuous.  

<ul>
  <li>Open sets in \(X / \sim\) are exactly the subsets \(U \subset X / \sim\) for which \(\pi^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(X\).</li>
  <li>Intuition: The quotient topology “inherits” openness from \(X\) via the projection map.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> Identify opposite edges of a square to form a torus. The quotient topology ensures that neighborhoods on the edges “glue together” properly.
</p>

<h3> 11: Symbols in equivalence and logic</h3>

</p>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) ~</strong><br>
  Denotes a general <strong>equivalence relation</strong> between elements.  
  Example: \(x \sim y\) means “x is equivalent to y under some defined rule.”  
  Used in quotient topology to define equivalence classes \([x] = \{y \in X : y \sim x\}\).</p>

  <p><strong>(b) ≡</strong><br>
  The triple line can mean several context-dependent things:  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identity / definition:</strong> \(f(x) \equiv x^2\) means “f(x) is defined to be x² for all x.”</li>
    <li><strong>Congruence modulo n:</strong> \(7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}\).</li>
    <li><strong>Logical equivalence:</strong> \(P \equiv Q\) in logic.</li>
  </ul>
  Note: It is not used as a general equivalence relation for quotient topology; \(\sim\) is used for that instead.</p>

  <p><strong>(c) ⇔</strong><br>
  A <strong>logical connective</strong> meaning “if and only if.”  
  Example: \(x \in A \Leftrightarrow x > 0\).  
  This is used between statements, not between elements, so it is not for defining equivalence classes.</p>

<h2> 12: Normed Vector Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Define a normed vector space and list the properties that the norm must satisfy.</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  A <strong>normed vector space</strong> is a vector space \(X\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\) equipped with a function 
  \(\|\cdot\| : X \to [0,\infty)\) called a <em>norm</em> that satisfies, for all \(x, y \in X\) and \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F}\):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive definiteness:</strong> \(\|x\| = 0 \iff x = 0\)</li>
    <li><strong>Homogeneity (absolute scalability):</strong> \(\|\alpha x\| = |\alpha| \cdot \|x\|\)</li>
    <li><strong>Triangle inequality:</strong> \(\|x + y\| \le \|x\| + \|y\|\)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The norm induces a metric \(d(x,y) = \|x - y\|\), so every normed vector space is also a metric space.</p>

<h2> 13: Equivalent Norms</h2>

<p><strong> (a):</strong> What does it mean for two norms to be equivalent?</p>

<textarea rows="4" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<p><strong> (b):</strong> Show a proof that equivalent norms induce the same topology.</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Equivalent Norms:</strong><br>
  Two norms \(\|\cdot\|_1\) and \(\|\cdot\|_2\) on a vector space \(V\) are called <strong>equivalent</strong> if there exist positive constants \(c_1, c_2 > 0\) such that for all \(x \in V\):
  \[
  c_1 \|x\|_1 \le \|x\|_2 \le c_2 \|x\|_1
  \]
  Equivalent norms induce the <strong>same topology</strong>, meaning they have the same notions of convergence and open sets.</p>

  <p><strong>(b) Proof Idea:</strong><br>
  Let \(x_n \to x\) in \(\|\cdot\|_1\). By equivalence, we have
  \[
  \|x_n - x\|_2 \le c_2 \|x_n - x\|_1 \to 0,
  \]
  so \(x_n \to x\) in \(\|\cdot\|_2\) as well. Hence, convergence is preserved and the norms induce the same topology.</p>

  <p><strong>Finite-Dimensional Case:</strong><br>
  If \(\dim V < \infty\), all norms on \(V\) are equivalent. For example, with a basis \(\{e_i\}\), we can define the infinity norm
  \(\|x\|_\infty = \max |x_i|\). Equivalence follows from finiteness of coordinates.</p>

  <p><strong>Infinite-Dimensional Case:</strong><br>
  In infinite-dimensional spaces, equivalence may fail. For instance, compactness properties that hold in finite dimensions may fail in \(\ell^\infty\), so the theorem “all norms are equivalent” does not hold.</p>

<h2> 14: Continuity of Linear Operators</h2>
  
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \((V, \|\cdot\|_V)\) and \((W, \|\cdot\|_W)\) be normed vector spaces. Define what it means for a linear map \(T: V \to W\) to be bounded (continuous).</p>

<textarea rows="6" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  A linear map \(T: V \to W\) is called <strong>bounded</strong> (or continuous) if there exists a constant \(M \ge 0\) such that for all \(x \in V\):
  \[
  \|T(x)\|_W \le M \|x\|_V.
  \]</p>
  <p><strong>Remark:</strong> In normed vector spaces, linear operators are continuous if and only if they are bounded. This is a key result in functional analysis.</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(T\) is bounded: there exists \(M \ge 0\) such that \(\|T(x)\|_W \le M \|x\|_V\) for all \(x \in V\).</li>
  <li>\(T\) is continuous at \(0 \in V\).</li>
  <li>\(T\) is continuous everywhere on \(V\).</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your proof here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>(1 ⇒ 3)</strong>: Suppose \(T\) is bounded, so there exists \(M \ge 0\) with \(\|T(x)\|_W \le M \|x\|_V\). For any \(x_0 \in V\) and \(x \in V\):</p>
  <p>\[
  \|T(x) - T(x_0)\|_W = \|T(x - x_0)\|_W \le M \|x - x_0\|_V,
  \]</p>
  <p>so \(T\) is continuous everywhere.</p>

  <p><strong>(3 ⇒ 2)</strong>: Trivial, because continuity everywhere implies continuity at \(0\).</p>

  <p><strong>(2 ⇒ 1)</strong>: Suppose \(T\) is continuous at \(0\). Then there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that \(\|x\|_V < \delta \implies \|T(x)\|_W < 1\). By linearity, for any non-zero \(x \in V\):</p>
  <p>\[
  T(x) = \frac{\delta}{\|x\|_V} T\Big(\frac{\|x\|_V}{\delta} x\Big) \implies \|T(x)\|_W \le \frac{\|x\|_V}{\delta}.
  \]</p>
  <p>Hence \(T\) is bounded with \(M = 1/\delta\).</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Boundedness, continuity at 0, and continuity everywhere are equivalent for linear maps between normed spaces.</p>

</details>





    




    
<h2> 16: Operator Norm</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(T: V \to W\) be a linear map between normed vector spaces \((V, \|\cdot\|_V)\) and \((W, \|\cdot\|_W)\). Define the <strong>operator norm</strong> of \(T\) and prove the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(\|T\| = \sup_{\|x\|_V \le 1} \|T(x)\|_W = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{\|T(x)\|_W}{\|x\|_V}\).</li>
  <li>If \(\dim V < \infty\), then every linear map \(T: V \to W\) is continuous (bounded).</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  The <strong>operator norm</strong> of \(T\) is defined by
  \[
  \|T\| := \sup_{\|x\|_V \le 1} \|T(x)\|_W.
  \]
  Equivalently, for \(x \neq 0\):
  \[
  \|T\| = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{\|T(x)\|_W}{\|x\|_V}.
  \]
  This gives the smallest constant \(M\) such that \(\|T(x)\|_W \le M \|x\|_V\) for all \(x \in V\).</p>

  <p><strong>Proof that \(\dim V < \infty \implies T\) is continuous:</strong><br>
  1. Let \(\dim V = n < \infty\) and choose a basis \(\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}\) of \(V\).<br>
  2. With respect to this basis, \(T\) can be represented as a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}\), mapping coordinates in \(V\) to coordinates in \(W\).<br>
  3. In finite dimensions, **all norms are equivalent**, so there exists constants \(c_1, c_2 > 0\) such that
     \[
     c_1 \|x\|_{\text{coord}} \le \|x\|_V \le c_2 \|x\|_{\text{coord}}.
     \]
  4. Then
     \[
     \|T(x)\|_W \le \|A\|_{\text{matrix}} \|x\|_{\text{coord}} \le \|A\|_{\text{matrix}} c_2 \|x\|_V,
     \]
     giving a bound. Hence \(T\) is bounded (continuous).</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In finite-dimensional spaces, every linear map is automatically continuous. The operator norm provides a quantitative measure of its “size.”</p>

    <h2> 16: Closed Subspaces of Banach Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a Banach space and \(Y \subset X\) be a closed linear subspace. Prove that \(Y\) is also a Banach space.</p>

<textarea rows="6" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Let \((y_n)\) be a Cauchy sequence in \(Y\). By definition of a Cauchy sequence:
    \[
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ s.t. } m,n \ge N \implies \|y_n - y_m\|_X < \epsilon.
    \]</li>

    <li>Since \(Y \subset X\), \((y_n)\) is also a Cauchy sequence in \(X\). Because \(X\) is Banach, there exists \(y \in X\) such that
    \[
    y_n \to y \text{ in } X.
    \]</li>

    <li>Since \(Y\) is closed in \(X\), the limit of any convergent sequence in \(Y\) lies in \(Y\). Hence
    \[
    y \in Y.
    \]</li>

    <li>Therefore, every Cauchy sequence in \(Y\) converges to a point in \(Y\). By definition, \(Y\) is Banach.</li>

<h2> 17: Quotient Spaces of Banach Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a Banach space and \(Y \subset X\) a closed subspace. Define the quotient space \(X/Y\) with the norm
\[

\]
Prove that \(X/Y\) is a Banach space.</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Let \((x_n + Y)\) be a Cauchy sequence in \(X/Y\). By definition of the quotient norm:
    \[
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ s.t. } m,n \ge N \implies \|x_n - x_m + Y\| < \epsilon.
    \]</li>

    <li>By the definition of the quotient norm, for each \(n\) we can pick representatives \(x_n' \in x_n + Y\) so that
    \(\|x_n' - x_m'\|_X < \epsilon + \frac{1}{n}\). Then \((x_n')\) is a Cauchy sequence in \(X\).</li>

    <li>Since \(X\) is Banach, \((x_n')\) converges to some \(x \in X\):
    \[
    x_n' \to x \text{ in } X.
    \]</li>

    <li>The sequence of cosets \(x_n + Y\) converges to \(x + Y\) in the quotient norm. Indeed,
    \[
    \|x_n + Y - (x + Y)\| = \inf_{y \in Y} \|x_n' - x + y\|_X \to 0,
    \]
    because \(Y\) is closed and contains all differences of representatives.</li>

    <li>Hence, every Cauchy sequence in \(X/Y\) converges in \(X/Y\), proving that \(X/Y\) is Banach.</li>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Statement (Real Case):</strong><br>
  Let \(X\) be a real vector space, \(Y \subset X\) a linear subspace, and \(p: X \to \mathbb{R}\) a sublinear function (i.e., positively homogeneous and subadditive). If \(f: Y \to \mathbb{R}\) is a linear functional such that
  \[
  f(y) \le p(y) \quad \forall y \in Y,
  \]
  then there exists a linear extension \(F: X \to \mathbb{R}\) of \(f\) (i.e., \(F|_Y = f\)) such that
  \[
  F(x) \le p(x) \quad \forall x \in X.
  \]</p>

  <p><strong>Corollary for Normed Spaces:</strong><br>
  If \(X\) is a normed space, \(Y \subset X\) a subspace, and \(f: Y \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)) is linear and bounded, then there exists an extension \(F: X \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)) with the same norm:
  \[
  \|F\| = \|f\|.
  \]</p>

  <p><strong>Proof Sketch (Real Case):</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Start with a subspace \(Y \subset X\) and a linear functional \(f: Y \to \mathbb{R}\) with \(f(y) \le p(y)\).</li>
    <li>Pick \(x_0 \in X \setminus Y\). Define a candidate extension \(f_1\) on \(Y_1 = Y + \mathrm{span}\{x_0\}\) by
      \[
      f_1(y + \alpha x_0) = f(y) + \alpha c
      \]
      for some \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) chosen to satisfy
      \[
      f_1(y + \alpha x_0) \le p(y + \alpha x_0) \quad \forall y \in Y, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}.
      \]</li>
    <li>By sublinearity of \(p\), such a \(c\) exists, giving a one-dimensional extension.</li>
    <li>Use Zorn’s lemma: consider the set of all pairs \((Z, g)\) where \(Y \subset Z \subset X\) and \(g: Z \to \mathbb{R}\) is linear with \(g \le p\). This set is partially ordered by inclusion.</li>
    <li>Every chain has an upper bound (union of subspaces and consistent extensions), so by Zorn’s lemma there exists a maximal element \((M, F)\).</li>
    <li>Maximality implies \(M = X\); otherwise, we could extend \(F\) further by one dimension. Hence \(F\) is a linear extension of \(f\) to all of \(X\) satisfying \(F \le p\).</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Any bounded linear functional on a subspace of a normed space can be extended to the whole space without increasing its norm. This is the Hahn–Banach theorem.</p>

    <li>But \(\pi_X^{-1}(x) = (x, T(x))\), so boundedness of \(\pi_X^{-1}\) implies

    <li>Define the sets
    \[
    E_n := \{ x \in X : \|T_\alpha(x)\|_Y \le n \text{ for all } \alpha \in A \}, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}.
    \]</li>

    <li>By assumption, for each \(x \in X\) there exists \(n\) such that \(x \in E_n\). Hence
    \[
    X = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n.

    <li>Each \(E_n\) is **closed**: if \(x_k \in E_n\) and \(x_k \to x\), then by continuity of each \(T_\alpha\),
    \[
    \|T_\alpha(x)\|_Y = \lim_{k \to \infty} \|T_\alpha(x_k)\|_Y \le n.
    \]</li>

    <li>Since \(X\) is Banach, by the **Baire category theorem**, there exists \(N\) such that \(E_N\) has **nonempty interior**. That is, there exists a ball \(B_X(x_0, r) \subset E_N\).</li>

    \[
    x = x_0 + (x - x_0) \in B_X(x_0, r) + B_X(0, \|x-x_0\|),

    \[
    \|T_\alpha(x)\|_Y \le \|T_\alpha(x_0)\|_Y + \|T_\alpha(x-x_0)\|_Y \le N + \frac{N}{r} \|x-x_0\|_X.

    <li>Hence there exists a constant \(M > 0\) independent of \(\alpha\) such that

  <p><strong>(a) Graph of a Map:</strong></p>
  <p>For any map \(T: X \to Y\), the <strong>graph</strong> of \(T\) is the subset of the product space \(X \times Y\) defined by
  \[

  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Continuous Dual Space:</strong></p>
  <p>The <strong>continuous dual space</strong> of a normed space \(X\) is
  \[
  X^* := \{ f: X \to \mathbb{F} \text{ linear and continuous (bounded)} \},
  \]
  where \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\).  
  By the equivalence theorem for linear operators on normed spaces, a linear functional \(f\) is continuous if and only if it is bounded, i.e., there exists \(M \ge 0\) such that
  \[
  |f(x)| \le M \|x\| \quad \forall x \in X.
  \]</p>

  <p><strong>(b) Operator Norm on the Dual:</strong></p>
  <p>For \(f \in X^*\), its norm is defined as
  \[
  \|f\| := \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{|f(x)|}{\|x\|}.
  \]
  Equivalently, using homogeneity of linear maps:
  \[
  \|f\| = \sup_{\|x\| \le 1} |f(x)|.
  \]
  This is exactly the <strong>operator norm</strong> of the linear functional \(f\).  
  It gives the smallest constant \(M\) satisfying \(|f(x)| \le M \|x\|\) for all \(x \in X\), which shows that every element of \(X^*\) is bounded.</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The continuous dual space \(X^*\) consists of all bounded linear functionals on \(X\), and the norm of a functional is exactly its operator norm.</p>

<h2> 23: The Continuous Dual of a Normed Space is Banach</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a normed space (not necessarily complete). Show that its continuous dual \(X^*\), equipped with the operator norm, is a Banach space. In particular, if \((f_n) \subset X^*\) is a Cauchy sequence, prove that it converges to some \(f \in X^*\).</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Let \(X\) be a normed space. Then \((X^*, \|\cdot\|)\) is a Banach space, i.e., every Cauchy sequence in \(X^*\) converges to a bounded linear functional in \(X^*\).</p>

  <p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Let \((f_n) \subset X^*\) be a Cauchy sequence in the operator norm. That is,
    \[
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ s.t. } m,n \ge N \implies \|f_n - f_m\| = \sup_{\|x\| \le 1} |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \epsilon.
    \]</li>

    <li>Fix \(x \in X\). Then for all \(m,n \ge N\),
    \[
    |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \le \|f_n - f_m\| \cdot \|x\| < \epsilon \|x\|.
    \]
    Hence, for each \(x \in X\), the sequence \((f_n(x))\) is Cauchy in \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\), which is complete. So we can define
    \[
    f(x) := \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x).
    \]</li>

    <li>Linearity of \(f\) follows from linearity of each \(f_n\) and the limit:
    \[
    f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha \lim f_n(x) + \beta \lim f_n(y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y).
    \]</li>

    <li>\(f\) is bounded: For all \(x \in X\),
    \[
    |f(x)| = \lim_{n \to \infty} |f_n(x)| \le \limsup_{n \to \infty} \|f_n\| \cdot \|x\|.
    \]
    Since \((f_n)\) is Cauchy, \(\sup_n \|f_n\| < \infty\). Hence \(\|f\| < \infty\) and \(f \in X^*\).</li>

    <li>Finally, convergence in the operator norm:
    \[
    \|f_n - f\| = \sup_{\|x\| \le 1} |f_n(x) - f(x)| \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
    \]</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Every Cauchy sequence in \(X^*\) converges in \(X^*\). Therefore, \((X^*, \|\cdot\|)\) is a Banach space, even if \(X\) is not complete.</p>

<h2> 24: Canonical Embedding into the Bidual</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a normed space and \(X^*\) its continuous dual. Define the canonical embedding \(J: X \to X^{**}\) (the bidual). Prove rigorously that \(J\) is linear and isometric.</p>

<textarea rows="6" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> For a normed space \(X\), the map
  \[
  J: X \to X^{**}, \quad J(x)(f) := f(x) \text{ for all } f \in X^*
  \]
  is linear and satisfies \(\|J(x)\| = \|x\|\). That is, \(J\) is an isometric embedding of \(X\) into its bidual.</p>

  <p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Linearity:</strong> For \(x, y \in X\) and \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}\),
    \[
    J(\alpha x + \beta y)(f) = f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y) = \alpha J(x)(f) + \beta J(y)(f),
    \]
    so \(J(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha J(x) + \beta J(y)\).</li>

    <li><strong>Norm-preserving (isometry):</strong> By definition of the operator norm,
    \[
    \|J(x)\| = \sup_{\|f\| \le 1} |J(x)(f)| = \sup_{\|f\| \le 1} |f(x)|.
    \]
    But by the definition of the dual norm,
    \[
    |f(x)| \le \|f\| \|x\| \le \|x\| \quad \forall \|f\| \le 1,
    \]
    so \(\|J(x)\| \le \|x\|\).</li>

    <li>To see equality, use the Hahn–Banach theorem: there exists \(f_0 \in X^*\) with \(\|f_0\| = 1\) such that
    \[
    f_0(x) = \|x\|.
    \]
    Then
    \[
    \|J(x)\| \ge |J(x)(f_0)| = |f_0(x)| = \|x\|.
    \]</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> \(\|J(x)\| = \|x\|\), so \(J\) is linear and isometric. This provides a natural way to identify \(X\) with a subspace of \(X^{**}\).</p>

<h2> 25: Weak and Weak-* Topologies</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Weak topology:</strong> Define the weak topology on \(X\) and describe its basic open sets.</li>
  <li><strong>Weak-* topology:</strong> Define the weak-* topology on \(X^*\) and describe its basic open sets.</li>
  <li><strong>Infinite-dimensional case:</strong> Explain why the weak and weak-* topologies are strictly weaker than the norm topology if \(X\) is infinite-dimensional, and give an intuitive reason.</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(1) Weak Topology on \(X\):</strong></p>
  <p>The <strong>weak topology</strong> on \(X\) is the coarsest topology making all functionals \(f \in X^*\) continuous. A net \((x_\alpha) \subset X\) converges weakly to \(x \in X\), written \(x_\alpha \rightharpoonup x\), if
  \[
  f(x_\alpha) \to f(x) \quad \forall f \in X^*.
  \]
  Basic open sets are of the form
  \[
  \{ y \in X : |f_i(y) - f_i(x_0)| < \epsilon, \ i=1,\dots,n \},
  \]
  for finitely many functionals \(f_1,\dots,f_n\), \(\epsilon > 0\), and \(x_0 \in X\).</p>

  <p><strong>(2) Weak-* Topology on \(X^*\):</strong></p>
  <p>The <strong>weak-* topology</strong> on \(X^*\) is the coarsest topology making the evaluation maps \(f \mapsto f(x)\) continuous for all \(x \in X\). A net \((f_\alpha) \subset X^*\) converges weak-* to \(f \in X^*\), written \(f_\alpha \overset{*}{\rightharpoonup} f\), if
  \[
  f_\alpha(x) \to f(x) \quad \forall x \in X.
  \]
  Basic open sets are of the form
  \[
  \{ g \in X^* : |g(x_i) - f(x_i)| < \epsilon, \ i=1,\dots,n \},
  \]
  for finitely many points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in X\), \(\epsilon > 0\), and \(f \in X^*\).</p>

  <p><strong>(3) Infinite-dimensional case:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In infinite-dimensional spaces, weak convergence is strictly weaker than norm convergence: a net can converge weakly without converging in norm. Intuition: only finitely many functionals “test” convergence at a time.</li>
    <li>Similarly, weak-* convergence is weaker than norm convergence on \(X^*\): a sequence may converge pointwise on \(X\) but not in operator norm.</li>
    <li>This explains phenomena like the Banach–Alaoglu theorem: closed balls in \(X^*\) are compact in the weak-* topology, even though they are never compact in norm if \(X\) is infinite-dimensional.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Weak and weak-* topologies provide weaker notions of convergence than norm convergence, making them crucial in infinite-dimensional functional analysis.</p>

<h2> 26: Weak Convergence of Sequences</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a normed space. Define what it means for a sequence \((x_n) \subset X\) to converge weakly to \(x \in X\). Give an example in an infinite-dimensional space where weak convergence occurs but norm convergence does not.</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Definition (Weak Convergence):</strong></p>
  <p>A sequence \((x_n) \subset X\) converges <strong>weakly</strong> to \(x \in X\), written \(x_n \rightharpoonup x\), if
  \[
  f(x_n) \to f(x) \quad \text{for all } f \in X^*,
  \]
  i.e., it converges pointwise when tested against every continuous linear functional.</p>

  <p><strong>Example in \(l^2\):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Let \(e_n = (0,0,\dots,1,0,\dots)\) be the standard basis of \(l^2\) (1 in the \(n\)-th coordinate, 0 elsewhere).</li>
    <li>Define the sequence \(x_n = e_n\). Then \(\|x_n\| = 1\) for all \(n\), so \(x_n\) does **not** converge in norm.</li>
    <li>However, for any \(f \in (l^2)^*\) (by Riesz representation, \(f(y) = \langle y, z\rangle\) for some \(z \in l^2\)), we have
    \[
    f(e_n) = \langle e_n, z \rangle = z_n \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty,
    \]
    since \(z \in l^2\) implies \(z_n \to 0\). Therefore, \(e_n \rightharpoonup 0\) weakly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This shows a sequence can converge weakly without converging in norm, a phenomenon that occurs only in infinite-dimensional spaces.</p>

<h2> 27: Banach–Alaoglu Theorem (proof)</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> State the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and prove that the closed unit ball in the dual space \(X^*\) is compact in the weak-* topology.</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Theorem (Banach–Alaoglu):</strong></p>
  <p>Let \(X\) be a normed space. Then the closed unit ball in the dual space
  \[
  B_{X^*} = \{ f \in X^* : \|f\| \le 1 \}
  \]
  is compact in the weak-* topology.</p>

  <p><strong>Proof (Sketch / Rigorous Outline):</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Consider the product space \(\Pi_{x \in X} \overline{\mathbb{D}}\), where \(\overline{\mathbb{D}} = \{ z \in \mathbb{F} : |z| \le 1 \}\) and \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R} \text{ or } \mathbb{C}\).</li>
    
    <li>By Tychonoff’s theorem, the product of compact spaces is compact in the product topology. So
    \[
    \Pi_{x \in X} \overline{\mathbb{D}}
    \]
    is compact.</li>
    
    <li>Each \(f \in B_{X^*}\) defines a point in this product via evaluation:
    \[
    f \mapsto (f(x))_{x \in X} \in \Pi_{x \in X} \overline{\mathbb{D}}.
    \]</li>
    
    <li>The weak-* topology on \(B_{X^*}\) is exactly the subspace topology induced by this product (since weak-* convergence is pointwise convergence on \(X\)).</li>
    
    <li>Thus, \(B_{X^*}\) is a closed subset of a compact space (the image under the embedding), so it is compact in the weak-* topology.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Remark / Intuition:</strong> Weak-* convergence tests only finitely many points of \(X\) at a time. Tychonoff’s theorem guarantees compactness in the infinite-dimensional setting, even though the unit ball is never norm-compact in infinite dimensions.</p>

</details>

      



      
<h2> 28: Banach–Alaoglu Theorem (Extended)</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> State the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and explain its consequences in the following contexts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Separability of \(X\) and weak-* metrisability of the dual unit ball.</li>
  <li>Sequential compactness in weak-* topology for separable spaces.</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Banach–Alaoglu Theorem:</strong> For a normed space \(X\), the closed unit ball in the dual
  \[
  B_{X^*} = \{ f \in X^* : \|f\| \le 1 \}
  \]
  is compact in the weak-* topology.</p>

  <p><strong>(1) Separability and weak-* metrisability:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If \(X\) is **separable**, then there exists a **countable dense subset** \(\{x_n\} \subset X\).</li>
    <li>The weak-* topology on \(B_{X^*}\) can then be defined using only evaluations at \(\{x_n\}\), giving a **countable subbasis**.</li>
    <li>By general topology, a compact space with a countable subbasis is **metrisable**. So the weak-* topology on \(B_{X^*}\) is **metrisable** for separable \(X\).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>(2) Sequential compactness:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>metrisable compact spaces are **sequentially compact**. Therefore, in a separable normed space \(X\), any sequence \((f_n) \subset B_{X^*}\) has a **weak-* convergent subsequence**.</li>
    <li>Intuition: Although \(B_{X^*}\) may not be norm-compact, weak-* convergence only tests finitely many points at a time, making sequential limits possible in separable spaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Summary / Intuition:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Banach–Alaoglu gives **compactness of the dual unit ball** in weak-* topology.</li>
    <li>If \(X\) is separable, the weak-* topology becomes **metrisable**, so compactness implies **sequential compactness**.</li>
    <li>This is a powerful tool: it guarantees existence of weak-* convergent subsequences in separable dual spaces.</li>

  <li><strong>Axiom of Choice (AC):</strong>  
  Given any collection of non-empty sets \(\{X_i\}_{i \in I}\), there exists a function \(f\) (a choice function) such that  
  \(f(i) \in X_i\) for each \(i \in I\).  
  Intuition: You can simultaneously pick one element from each set, even infinitely many sets.</li>

  <li><strong>Tychonoff’s Theorem:</strong>  
  The product of any collection of compact topological spaces \(\prod_{i \in I} X_i\) is compact in the product topology.

<ol>
  <li><strong>Filter on a set \(X\):</strong>  
    A filter \(\mathcal{F}\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) satisfying:
    <ul>
      <li>\(X \in \mathcal{F}\), \(\emptyset \notin \mathcal{F}\)</li>
      <li>Closed under finite intersections: If \(A, B \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(A \cap B \in \mathcal{F}\)</li>
      <li>Upward closed: If \(A \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(A \subset B \subset X\), then \(B \in \mathcal{F}\)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Intuition:</strong> A filter collects the “large” or “significant” subsets of \(X\) — sets that matter for convergence.</li>

  <li><strong>Ultrafilter on a set \(X\):</strong>  
    An ultrafilter \(\mathcal{U}\) is a **maximal filter**, meaning:
    <ul>
      <li>It is a filter.</li>
      <li>For every subset \(A \subset X\), either \(A \in \mathcal{U}\) or \(X \setminus A \in \mathcal{U}\) (never both).</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Difference from a general filter:</strong> An ultrafilter makes a “decision” for every subset: it is either “large” (in the ultrafilter) or “small” (its complement is in the ultrafilter).  
    <strong>Intuition:</strong> An ultrafilter is a filter that is as “decisive” as possible, which allows it to define limits in arbitrary product spaces.</li>

<h2>Tychonoff’s Theorem: Infinite Product Case</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Prove that the product of an arbitrary collection of compact spaces is compact (infinite case), and explain why the Axiom of Choice is needed.</p>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \(\{X_i\}_{i \in I}\) be compact topological spaces (possibly infinitely many). Then the product space  
\[
X = \prod_{i \in I} X_i
\]  
with the product topology is compact.</p>

<p><strong>Proof using ultrafilters:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be an **ultrafilter** on \(X\). To show compactness, it suffices to show that \(\mathcal{U}\) converges to some point \(x \in X\).</li>

  <li>For each coordinate \(i \in I\), define the **projected ultrafilter** on \(X_i\):  
  \[
  \mathcal{U}_i = \{ A \subset X_i : \pi_i^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{U} \}.
  \]</li>

  <li>Since each \(X_i\) is compact, the ultrafilter \(\mathcal{U}_i\) **converges** to some point \(x_i \in X_i\).</li>

  <li>Define the point in the product:  
  \[
  x = (x_i)_{i \in I} \in \prod_{i \in I} X_i.
  \]</li>

  <li>Check convergence:  
  - A basic open neighborhood of \(x\) in the product topology depends only on finitely many coordinates.  
  - For each finite subset \(F \subset I\), the sets \(\pi_i^{-1}(U_i) \in \mathcal{U}\) (with \(U_i\) neighborhoods of \(x_i\)) intersect to give a set in \(\mathcal{U}\).  
  - This shows that \(\mathcal{U}\) contains every basic neighborhood of \(x\), so \(\mathcal{U} \to x\).</li>

  <li>Since **every ultrafilter converges**, the product space \(X\) is compact.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why Axiom of Choice is needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Constructing the point \(x = (x_i)\) requires **choosing a limit \(x_i\) in each factor \(X_i\)** simultaneously.</li>
  <li>For infinitely many indices, there is no canonical rule for these choices, so we need a **choice function**, which is guaranteed by AC.</li>
  <li>Thus, Tychonoff’s theorem for infinite products is **equivalent to the Axiom of Choice**.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Intuition:</strong> Each factor is compact → each coordinate has a “limit.” Infinite product → pick a point in each coordinate consistently → use ultrafilters + AC → product is compact.</p>

<h2> 31: Goldstine's Theorem</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a normed space with unit ball \(B_X = \{x \in X : \|x\| \le 1\}\) and let \(J : X \to X^{**}\) be the canonical embedding into the bidual. State and prove Goldstine’s theorem, including the case when \(X\) is not reflexive.</p>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Goldstine’s Theorem:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Let \(X\) be a normed space, \(B_X\) its closed unit ball, and \(J: X \to X^{**}\) the canonical embedding. Then  
  \[
  J(B_X) \text{ is weak-* dense in } B_{X^{**}}.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Remark:</strong> Even if \(X\) is **not reflexive** (so \(X \subsetneq X^{**}\)), its unit ball is still weak-* dense in the bidual unit ball. This means we can approximate any element of \(B_{X^{**}}\) arbitrarily closely in the weak-* topology using elements from \(X\).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Proof (Sketch using Hahn–Banach):</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(F \in B_{X^{**}}\) and consider a weak-* neighborhood of \(F\) of the form  
  \[
  U = \{ G \in X^{**} : |G(f_i) - F(f_i)| < \epsilon, \, i = 1,\dots,n \}
  \]  
  for finitely many \(f_1,\dots,f_n \in X^*\) and \(\epsilon > 0\).</li>

  <li>Define the linear map \(T: \text{span}\{f_1,\dots,f_n\} \subset X^* \to \mathbb{F}\) by  
  \[
  T\Big(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i f_i\Big) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i F(f_i).
  \]</li>

  <li>\(T\) is bounded by the norm of \(F\), so by the **Hahn–Banach theorem**, \(T\) can be extended to a functional \(\tilde{T} \in X^{**}\) with \(\|\tilde{T}\| \le \|F\| \le 1\).</li>

  <li>By the **definition of the canonical embedding** \(J\), there exists \(x \in B_X\) such that  
  \[
  J(x)(f_i) = f_i(x) \approx F(f_i), \quad i = 1,\dots,n.
  \]</li>

  <li>Since \(U\) was arbitrary, this shows that for every weak-* neighborhood \(U\) of \(F\), there exists \(x \in B_X\) with \(J(x) \in U\). Hence \(J(B_X)\) is **weak-* dense** in \(B_{X^{**}}\).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Intuition:</strong> The Hahn–Banach theorem allows us to “approximate” the action of any element in the bidual by evaluating on finitely many functionals, which is exactly what the weak-* topology tests. Even in non-reflexive spaces, the original unit ball is dense enough to “cover” all weak-* neighborhoods.</p>

<h2>Reflexive Banach Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a Banach space. State the equivalent characterisations of reflexivity and prove that they are indeed equivalent.</p>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Key Points</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Banach space \(X\) is <strong>reflexive</strong> if the canonical embedding  
\[
J: X \to X^{**}, \quad J(x)(f) = f(x), \quad f \in X^*,
\]  
is **surjective**, i.e., \(J(X) = X^{**}\).</p>

<p><strong>Equivalent statements:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Reflexivity:</strong> \(X \cong X^{**}\) via the canonical embedding.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit ball weakly compact:</strong> The closed unit ball \(B_X = \{x \in X : \|x\| \le 1\}\) is compact in the **weak topology**.</li>
  <li><strong>Dual reflexivity:</strong> \(X^*\) is reflexive (i.e., \(X^* \cong X^{***}\)).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Proof of equivalence:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>(1 ⇒ 2) Reflexive ⇒ unit ball weakly compact:</strong>  
    - If \(X\) is reflexive, \(B_X\) is mapped onto \(B_{X^{**}}\) via \(J\).  
    - By **Banach–Alaoglu**, \(B_{X^{**}}\) is weak-* compact.  
    - The weak topology on \(X\) coincides with the restriction of the weak-* topology on \(X^{**}\) via \(J\), so \(B_X\) is weakly compact.</li>

  <li><strong>(2 ⇒ 1) Unit ball weakly compact ⇒ reflexive:</strong>  
    - Assume \(B_X\) is weakly compact.  
    - By Goldstine, \(J(B_X)\) is weak-* dense in \(B_{X^{**}}\).  
    - Since \(B_X\) is weakly compact, it is closed in the weak-* topology.  
    - Density + closedness ⇒ \(J(B_X) = B_{X^{**}}\).  
    - Scaling shows \(J(X) = X^{**}\), so \(X\) is reflexive.</li>

  <li><strong>(1 ⇔ 3) Reflexivity ⇔ dual reflexivity:</strong>  
    - If \(X\) is reflexive, \(X \cong X^{**}\).  
    - Then \(X^* \cong X^{***}\), so \(X^*\) is reflexive.  
    - Conversely, if \(X^*\) is reflexive, \(X \cong X^{**}\) by duality.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These statements are equivalent, providing multiple perspectives on reflexivity: via the canonical embedding, via weak compactness of the unit ball, or via dual reflexivity.</p>

<h2> 32: Hilbert Spaces and Inner Product</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Define a Hilbert space. List the properties of an inner product and show how it induces a norm.</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Key Points</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>Hilbert space</strong> is a complete inner product space \(H\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\). That is, \(H\) is a vector space with an inner product \(\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle\) such that the metric induced by the inner product is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Inner product properties:</strong> For all \(x, y, z \in H\) and \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F} (\mathbb{R} \text{ or } \mathbb{C})\):</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Conjugate symmetry / symmetry:</strong>  
  \[
  \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle} \quad (\text{real case: } \langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle)
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Linearity in the first argument:</strong>  
  \[
  \langle \alpha x + y, z \rangle = \alpha \langle x, z \rangle + \langle y, z \rangle
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Positive definiteness:</strong>  
  \[
  \langle x, x \rangle \ge 0, \quad \langle x, x \rangle = 0 \iff x = 0
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Norm induced by inner product:</strong>  
\[
\|x\| = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}, \quad x \in H
\]  
This norm satisfies all properties of a norm (positivity, homogeneity, triangle inequality via Cauchy–Schwarz inequality), making \(H\) a normed space. Completeness with respect to this norm makes it a Hilbert space.</p>

</details>









  

<h2> 33: Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\) with inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\). Prove the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in both finite and infinite-dimensional cases.</p>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Theorem (Cauchy–Schwarz inequality):</strong> For all \(x, y \in H\),  
\[
|\langle x, y \rangle| \le \|x\| \, \|y\|.
\]  
Equality holds iff \(x\) and \(y\) are linearly dependent.</p>

<h3>Proof (Finite-dimensional case)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If \(y = 0\), inequality is trivial. Assume \(y \neq 0\).</li>
  <li>Consider the scalar \(\alpha = \frac{\langle x, y \rangle}{\|y\|^2}\) and the vector \(z = x - \alpha y\).</li>
  <li>By positive definiteness, \(\|z\|^2 \ge 0\), so  
  \[
  \|x - \alpha y\|^2 = \langle x - \alpha y, x - \alpha y \rangle \ge 0.
  \]</li>
  <li>Expand:  
  \[
  \|x\|^2 - \frac{|\langle x, y \rangle|^2}{\|y\|^2} \ge 0 \implies |\langle x, y \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2 \|y\|^2.
  \]</li>
  <li>Take square roots to get  
  \(|\langle x, y \rangle| \le \|x\| \, \|y\|.\)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Proof (Infinite-dimensional case)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) be an orthonormal basis for \(H\) (or consider an orthonormal sequence spanning the subspace containing \(x, y\)).</li>
  <li>Expand \(x = \sum_{i} x_i e_i\), \(y = \sum_{i} y_i e_i\), where the sums converge in norm (since \(H\) is complete).</li>
  <li>Compute  
  \[
  \langle x, y \rangle = \sum_i \overline{x_i} y_i.
  \]</li>
  <li>Apply the finite-dimensional Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the finite partial sums:  
  \[
  \Big|\sum_{i=1}^n \overline{x_i} y_i\Big| \le \Big(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^2\Big)^{1/2} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i|^2\Big)^{1/2}.
  \]</li>
  <li>Take the limit \(n \to \infty\) using completeness and norm convergence:  
  \[
  |\langle x, y \rangle| \le \|x\| \, \|y\|.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality holds in both finite and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It is a cornerstone of Hilbert space theory, underlying the triangle inequality, orthogonality, and projections.</p>

<h2> 34: Bessel's Inequality</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\) with inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\). Let \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) be an orthonormal sequence in \(H\). Prove Bessel's inequality for any \(x \in H\).</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Theorem (Bessel's inequality):</strong></p>

<p>For any \(x \in H\) and orthonormal sequence \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\),  
\[
\sum_{i \in I} |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2.
\]</p>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}\) be a finite subset of the orthonormal sequence. Consider the finite linear combination (the orthogonal projection of \(x\) onto \(\text{span}\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}\)):  
  \[
  P_n x = \sum_{i=1}^n \langle x, e_i \rangle e_i.
  \]</li>

  <li>By Pythagoras’ theorem (since \(x - P_n x\) is orthogonal to each \(e_i\)), we have  
  \[
  \|x\|^2 = \|P_n x\|^2 + \|x - P_n x\|^2 \ge \|P_n x\|^2.
  \]</li>

  <li>Compute the norm of the projection:  
  \[
  \|P_n x\|^2 = \left\| \sum_{i=1}^n \langle x, e_i \rangle e_i \right\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2.
  \]</li>

  <li>Thus, for any finite subset,  
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^n |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2.
  \]</li>

  <li>For an infinite orthonormal sequence, take the supremum over all finite subsets:  
  \[
  \sum_{i \in I} |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 = \sup_{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Bessel’s inequality shows that the “energy” of \(x\) along any orthonormal sequence is bounded by the total squared norm of \(x\). It is the key step toward Parseval’s identity and the theory of orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces.</p>

<h2> 35: Parseval's Identity and Orthonormal Bases</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space. </p>
<ol>
  <li>State and prove that every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis.</li>
  <li>Let \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) be an orthonormal basis of \(H\). Prove Parseval’s identity for any \(x \in H\).</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<h3>Part 1: Existence of an Orthonormal Basis</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Every Hilbert space \(H\) admits an orthonormal basis \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\), i.e., a maximal orthonormal set whose span is dense in \(H\).</p>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Start with any non-zero vector \(x_1 \in H\) and normalise it: \(e_1 = x_1 / \|x_1\|\).</li>
  <li>Use Zorn's lemma (or transfinite induction) to extend any orthonormal set to a **maximal orthonormal set** \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\). This is possible because the union of a chain of orthonormal sets is orthonormal.</li>
  <li>Maximality implies that the span of \(\{e_i\}\) is dense in \(H\); otherwise, there exists \(x \notin \overline{\text{span}\{e_i\}}\), and we could normalise its orthogonal component to extend the set, contradicting maximality.</li>
  <li>Thus \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) is an orthonormal basis of \(H\).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> This works even for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Zorn's lemma ensures the existence of maximal orthonormal sets.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Parseval's Identity</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem (Parseval's identity):</strong></p>

<p>Let \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) be an orthonormal basis of \(H\). Then for any \(x \in H\),  
\[
x = \sum_{i \in I} \langle x, e_i \rangle e_i \quad \text{(convergent in norm),}
\]  
and  
\[
\|x\|^2 = \sum_{i \in I} |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2.
\]</p>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Bessel’s inequality:</strong>  
  For any finite subset \(\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}\),  
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^n |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2: Partial sums:</strong>  
  Let \(P_n x = \sum_{i=1}^n \langle x, e_i \rangle e_i\). Then \(x - P_n x\) is orthogonal to each \(e_i\) in the span.</li>

  <li><strong>Step 3: Completeness:</strong>  
  Since \(\{e_i\}_{i \in I}\) is an orthonormal basis, the span is dense. Hence \(\|x - P_n x\| \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), giving  
  \[
  x = \sum_{i \in I} \langle x, e_i \rangle e_i.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 4: Norm equality:</strong>  
  Using Pythagoras for orthogonal components:  
  \[
  \|x\|^2 = \|P_n x\|^2 + \|x - P_n x\|^2 \to \sum_{i \in I} |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis, and Parseval’s identity provides a complete “energy decomposition” of vectors along that basis.</p>

\[
x = y + z, \quad y \in M, \, z \in M^\perp,
\]  
where \(M^\perp = \{ w \in H : \langle w, m \rangle = 0 \ \forall m \in M\}\). Show that \(y\) is the orthogonal projection of \(x\) onto \(M\).</p>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Projection Theorem:</strong> For every closed subspace \(M \subset H\) and \(x \in H\), there exists a **unique** decomposition  
\[
x = y + z, \quad y \in M, \ z \in M^\perp,
\]  
where \(y\) is the orthogonal projection of \(x\) onto \(M\).</p>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Existence of closest point:</strong>  
  Consider the distance from \(x\) to \(M\):  
  \[
  d = \inf_{m \in M} \|x - m\|.
  \]  
  Since \(M\) is closed and \(H\) is complete, there exists \(y \in M\) such that  
  \[
  \|x - y\| = d.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2: characterisation via inner product:</strong>  
  For any \(m \in M\) and scalar \(\alpha\), consider the function  
  \[
  f(\alpha) = \| x - (y + \alpha m) \|^2 \ge \|x - y\|^2.
  \]  
  Expand:  
  \[
  f(\alpha) = \|x - y\|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(\alpha \langle x - y, m \rangle) + |\alpha|^2 \|m\|^2.
  \]  
  Minimality at \(\alpha = 0\) implies  
  \[
  \text{Re}(\langle x - y, m \rangle) = 0 \quad \forall m \in M.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 3: Orthogonality:</strong>  
  Replacing \(m\) by \(i m\) in the complex case, we also get \(\text{Im}(\langle x - y, m \rangle) = 0\).  
  Hence \(\langle x - y, m \rangle = 0\) for all \(m \in M\), i.e.,  
  \[
  z := x - y \in M^\perp.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 4: Uniqueness:</strong>  
  Suppose \(x = y_1 + z_1 = y_2 + z_2\) with \(y_i \in M\), \(z_i \in M^\perp\). Then  
  \[
  y_1 - y_2 = z_2 - z_1 \in M \cap M^\perp.
  \]  
  But \(M \cap M^\perp = \{0\}\), so \(y_1 = y_2\) and \(z_1 = z_2\).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Every vector in a Hilbert space can be **uniquely decomposed** into a part in a closed subspace and a part in its orthogonal complement. The map \(x \mapsto y\) defines the **orthogonal projection** onto \(M\).</p>

  \[
  \|T x_n - T x\| = \|T(x_n - x)\| \le M \|x_n - x\| \to 0.

  <li>Fix \(y \in H\) and define the linear functional \(f_y(x) := \langle Tx, y \rangle\). Then \(f_y \in H^*\) (continuous dual) since  
  \(|f_y(x)| = |\langle Tx, y \rangle| \le \|Tx\| \|y\| \le \|T\| \|x\| \|y\|\).</li>
  
  <li>By the Riesz Representation Theorem, there exists a unique \(z \in H\) such that  
  \[
  f_y(x) = \langle x, z \rangle \quad \forall x \in H.
  \]  
  Define \(T^* y := z\).</li>

  <li>Uniqueness follows from uniqueness in the Riesz representation. Linearity and boundedness of \(T^*\) also follow:  
  \(\|T^*\| = \|T\|\).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Every bounded operator on a Hilbert space has a unique adjoint operator.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Special Classes of Operators</h3>

  Properties: square roots exist, spectrum lies in \([0, \infty)\).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> These classes are fundamental in spectral theory, quantum mechanics, and functional analysis.</p>

<h2> 38: Unitary Operators Preserve Inner Products and Norms</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(U: H \to H\) be a unitary operator on a Hilbert space \(H\), i.e., \(U^* U = U U^* = I\). Prove that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(\|Ux\| = \|x\|\) for all \(x \in H\) (norm-preserving).</li>
  <li>\(\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle\) for all \(x, y \in H\) (inner product-preserving).</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<h3>Proposition:</h3>

<p>If \(U\) is unitary (\(U^* U = I\)), then for all \(x, y \in H\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\|Ux\| = \|x\|\)</li>
  <li>\(\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Norm preservation:</strong>  
  \[
  \|Ux\|^2 = \langle Ux, Ux \rangle = \langle x, U^* U x \rangle = \langle x, x \rangle = \|x\|^2.
  \]  
  Taking square roots gives \(\|Ux\| = \|x\|\).</li>

  <li><strong>Inner product preservation:</strong>  
  For any \(x, y \in H\):  
  \[
  \langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, U^* U y \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Unitary operators preserve both norms and inner products, and thus preserve the Hilbert space structure. They are isometries of \(H\).</p>

<h2> 39: Isometries in Hilbert Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Define an <strong>isometry</strong> on a Hilbert space \(H\) and give an example. Explain why every unitary operator is an isometry.</p>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

<h3>Definition (Isometry):</h3>

<p>A linear operator \(T: H \to H\) on a Hilbert space \(H\) is called an <strong>isometry</strong> if it preserves norms, i.e.,</p>

\[
\|Tx\| = \|x\| \quad \forall x \in H.
\]

<p>Equivalently, \(T\) preserves the inner product: \(\langle Tx, Ty \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle\) for all \(x, y \in H\).</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The identity operator \(I: H \to H\) is trivially an isometry.</li>
  <li>Any unitary operator \(U\) is an isometry, since \(\|Ux\| = \|x\|\) and \(\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle\).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Every unitary operator is an isometry, but not every isometry is unitary (it may not be surjective).</p>

  <h3>Key Points: Spectral Theory for Bounded Operators</h3>

<p>Let \(T: H \to H\) be a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space \(H\).</p>

<h3>Key Definitions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resolvent set:</strong>  
  \(\rho(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : (T - \lambda I) \text{ is bijective and } (T - \lambda I)^{-1} \text{ is bounded} \}.\)</li>

  <li><strong>Spectrum:</strong>  
  \(\sigma(T) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \rho(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : T - \lambda I \text{ is not invertible}\}.\)</li>

  <li><strong>Point spectrum:</strong> Eigenvalues of \(T\):  
  \(\sigma_p(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : \exists x \neq 0, Tx = \lambda x \}\).</li>

  <li><strong>Continuous spectrum:</strong>  
  \(\sigma_c(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : T - \lambda I \text{ injective, range dense, not surjective}\}.\)</li>

  <li><strong>Residual spectrum:</strong>  
  \(\sigma_r(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : T - \lambda I \text{ injective, range not dense}\}.\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Properties:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The spectrum \(\sigma(T)\) is a non-empty compact subset of \(\mathbb{C}\).</li>
  <li>For any \(\lambda \notin \sigma(T)\), the resolvent operator \(R_\lambda(T) = (T - \lambda I)^{-1}\) exists and is bounded.</li>
  <li>For a bounded operator, \(\sigma(T) \subset \{ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} : |\lambda| \le \|T\| \}\).</li>
  <li>If \(T\) is compact, then every non-zero \(\lambda \in \sigma(T)\) is an eigenvalue with finite multiplicity, and \(0\) is the only possible accumulation point.</li>
  <li>Spectrum of a self-adjoint operator is real; for unitary operators, it lies on the unit circle; for positive operators, in \([0, \infty)\).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remark:</h3>

<p>Spectral theory provides a decomposition of bounded operators and 
  is fundamental for functional calculus, solving operator equations, 
  and understanding operator behavior in Hilbert spaces. 
  Compact operators behave like “infinite-dimensional matrices” with discrete 
  spectra accumulating only at 0.</p>















  
<h3>Key Points: Spectral Theorem for Bounded Self-Adjoint Operators</h3>

<p>Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space and \(T: H \to H\) a bounded self-adjoint operator (\(T = T^*\)).</p>

<h4>Key Idea:</h4>
<p>Every bounded self-adjoint operator can be “diagonalised” in a Hilbert space sense using a <strong>projection-valued measure</strong> (PVM). This generalises the concept of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to infinite-dimensional spaces.</p>

<h4>Definitions:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Projection-Valued Measure (PVM):</strong>  
  A map \(E: \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{B}(H)\) from the Borel sets of \(\mathbb{R}\) to bounded projections on \(H\) satisfying:
    <ol>
      <li>\(E(\emptyset) = 0, E(\mathbb{R}) = I\)</li>
      <li>\(E(B_1 \cap B_2) = E(B_1) E(B_2)\)</li>
      <li>\(E(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty E(B_n)\) for disjoint Borel sets (strong operator topology convergence)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Spectral Theorem (Bounded Self-Adjoint Version):</h4>

<p>There exists a unique PVM \(E\) such that:</p>

\[
T = \int_{\sigma(T)} \lambda \, dE(\lambda)
\]

<p>and for any bounded Borel function \(f: \sigma(T) \to \mathbb{C}\),</p>

\[
f(T) = \int_{\sigma(T)} f(\lambda) \, dE(\lambda)
\]

<p>This is called the <strong>functional calculus</strong> for \(T\).</p>

<h4>Properties:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>\(\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb{R}\)</li>
  <li>The PVM \(E(B)\) projects onto the subspace where \(T\) “takes values” in \(B \subset \mathbb{R}\)</li>
  <li>If \(T\) has purely discrete spectrum, \(E\) reduces to projections onto eigenspaces</li>
  <li>Allows defining functions of \(T\) rigorously</li>
</ul>

<h4>Intuition:</h4>

<p>Think of \(T\) as an infinite-dimensional “diagonal matrix”: each \(\lambda \in \sigma(T)\) acts like an eigenvalue, and \(E(\{\lambda\})\) projects onto the corresponding subspace. The integral sums over all these “eigencomponents.”</p>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Sketch of Proof</strong></summary>

<h4>Step 1: Reduce to real C*-algebra:</h4>
<p>The C*-algebra generated by \(T\) and \(I\) is commutative and self-adjoint.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Apply Gelfand Representation:</h4>
<p>For a commutative unital C*-algebra, there exists a *-isomorphism to continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. Here, the spectrum \(\sigma(T)\) plays that role.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Construct the PVM:</h4>
<p>Use the Riesz-Markov theorem to associate each Borel set \(B \subset \sigma(T)\) with a projection \(E(B)\) such that</p>
\[
\langle x, E(B) x \rangle = \mu_x(B)
\]  
for a measure \(\mu_x\) induced by the state \(x \mapsto \langle x, T x \rangle\).</p>

<h4>Step 4: Express \(T\) as the integral:</h4>
<p>Define the operator integral</p>
\[
T = \int_{\sigma(T)} \lambda \, dE(\lambda),
\]  
which recovers the action of \(T\) on every vector via \(\langle x, T x \rangle = \int \lambda \, d\mu_x(\lambda)\).</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> If \(T\) has discrete spectrum, the integral reduces to a sum over eigenvalues with orthogonal projections, connecting back to finite-dimensional diagonalisation.</p>

<h3>1. Key Points: Functional Calculus for Bounded Self-Adjoint Operators</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem (Continuous Functional Calculus):</strong></p>

<p>Let \(T: H \to H\) be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \(H\) and let \(\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb{R}\) be its spectrum. For every continuous function \(f: \sigma(T) \to \mathbb{C}\), there exists a unique bounded operator \(f(T)\) such that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If \(f(\lambda) = \lambda\), then \(f(T) = T\).</li>
  <li>If \(f \equiv 1\), then \(f(T) = I\).</li>
  <li>The map \(f \mapsto f(T)\) is a *-homomorphism:  
  \(\overline{f}(T) = f(T)^*\), \((fg)(T) = f(T) g(T)\).</li>
  <li>\(\|f(T)\| = \sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(T)} |f(\lambda)|\).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Take \(T\) self-adjoint and \(f(\lambda) = \lambda^2\). Then \(f(T) = T^2\).</li>
  <li>For \(f(\lambda) = e^{i\lambda}\), \(f(T)\) defines a unitary operator \(e^{iT}\).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Compact Self-Adjoint Operators: Discrete Spectrum</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \(T: H \to H\) be a compact self-adjoint operator. Then:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The spectrum \(\sigma(T)\) is at most countable.</li>
  <li>0 is the only possible accumulation point of \(\sigma(T)\).</li>
  <li>All non-zero elements of \(\sigma(T)\) are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity.</li>
  <li>There exists an orthonormal basis of \(H\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(T\).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Non-zero eigenvalues exist:</strong>  
  If \(T \neq 0\), then by compactness, \(T\) maps the unit ball to a relatively compact set. Using the Riesz lemma, one shows the existence of \(\lambda \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 0\) such that \(Tx = \lambda x\).</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2: Orthogonality of eigenvectors:</strong>  
  If \(x\) and \(y\) are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues \(\lambda \neq \mu\), then  
  \(\langle Tx, y \rangle = \lambda \langle x, y \rangle = \langle x, Ty \rangle = \mu \langle x, y \rangle\).  
  Hence \(\langle x, y \rangle = 0\).</li>

  <li><strong>Step 3: Discreteness of non-zero spectrum:</strong>  
  Assume an infinite sequence of non-zero eigenvalues accumulating at a non-zero point. Compactness implies existence of a convergent subsequence in \(H\), leading to a contradiction. Hence, 0 is the only possible accumulation point.</li>

  <li><strong>Step 4: Orthonormal basis of eigenvectors:</strong>  
  Take the span of eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues and complete it with an orthonormal basis of \(\ker(T)\). This gives an orthonormal basis of \(H\) diagonalising \(T\).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Hilbert-Schmidt operators on \(L^2([0,1])\) are compact and self-adjoint. Their eigenfunctions form a countable orthonormal basis, e.g., Fourier sine/cosine series.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Compact self-adjoint operators behave like infinite-dimensional symmetric matrices: their “diagonalisation” generalises classical linear algebra, and functional calculus allows applying functions to these operators.</p>

<h3>1. Bounded Linear Operators</h3>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A linear operator \(T: H \to H\) is <strong>bounded</strong> if there exists \(C \ge 0\) such that</p>

\[
\|Tx\| \le C \|x\| \quad \forall x \in H.
\]

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

</ul>

<h3>2. Compact Operators</h3>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> \(T: H \to H\) is <strong>compact</strong> if the image of the unit ball is relatively compact, i.e., every bounded sequence \((x_n)\) has a subsequence \((Tx_{n_k})\) converging in \(H\).</p>

<p><strong>Key Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Every compact operator is bounded.</li>
  <li>Spectrum \(\sigma(T)\) is at most countable, with 0 as the only possible accumulation point.</li>
  <li>Non-zero spectrum consists of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity.</li>

  <li>\(\ker(T)\) is finite-dimensional</li>
  <li>\(\operatorname{coker}(T) = H / \operatorname{ran}(T)\) is finite-dimensional</li>
  <li>\(\operatorname{ran}(T)\) is closed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Index of a Fredholm operator:</strong></p>
\[
\mathrm{index}(T) = \dim \ker(T) - \dim \operatorname{coker}(T).
\]

<p><strong>Example:</strong> \(T = I + K\), where \(K\) is compact, is Fredholm with index 0.</p>

</details>











<h2>Key Points: Spectral Theory of Compact Operators </h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition:</strong> \(T: H \to H\) (Hilbert or Banach space) is compact if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets (i.e., every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence).</li>

  <li><strong>Spectrum is discrete (except 0):</strong>  
      - \(\sigma(T) \setminus \{0\}\) consists of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity.  
      - 0 is the only possible accumulation point.</li>

  <li><strong>Eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis (Hilbert case):</strong>  
      - There exists an orthonormal set of eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues.  
      - Completing with a basis of \(\ker(T)\) gives a full orthonormal basis of \(H\).</li>

  <li><strong>Functional calculus:</strong>  
      - Functions of compact self-adjoint operators can be expressed in terms of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors:  
      \[
      f(T) x = \sum_{n} f(\lambda_n) \langle x, e_n \rangle e_n
      \]</li>

  <li><strong>Adjoint:</strong>  
      - If \(T\) is compact, \(T^*\) is also compact.  
      - Non-zero spectra of \(T\) and \(T^*\) coincide.</li>

  <li><strong>Examples:</strong>  
      - Hilbert-Schmidt operators (integral operators with square-integrable kernels)  
      - Finite-rank operators  
      - Compact perturbations of the identity: \(I + K\)</li>
  
  <li><strong>Importance:</strong>  
      - Compact operators generalise finite-dimensional linear algebra to infinite dimensions.  
      - Their spectral decomposition is fundamental in solving operator equations, PDEs, and functional analysis problems.</li>
</ul>



  





  <h2> 41: Riesz Projection</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(T: X \to X\) be a bounded linear operator on a Banach space \(X\), and let \(\sigma(T)\) be its spectrum. Suppose \(\Gamma \subset \mathbb{C}\) is a closed contour in the resolvent set of \(T\) that encloses an isolated part of the spectrum \(\sigma_0 \subset \sigma(T)\). Define the <strong>Riesz projection</strong> corresponding to \(\sigma_0\) and state its key properties.</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<h3>Definition (Riesz Projection):</h3>

<p>The Riesz projection \(P\) corresponding to the isolated spectral subset \(\sigma_0\) is defined by:</p>

\[
P = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\Gamma} (zI - T)^{-1} \, dz
\]

<p>where \(\Gamma\) is a positively oriented contour enclosing \(\sigma_0\) and no other points of \(\sigma(T)\).</p>

<h3>Key Properties:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Projection:</strong> \(P^2 = P\), i.e., \(P\) is idempotent.</li>
  <li><strong>Invariant subspace:</strong> \(\operatorname{ran}(P)\) and \(\ker(P)\) are invariant under \(T\).</li>
  <li><strong>Decomposition of \(T\):</strong>  
      \[
      T = T_0 \oplus T_1 \quad \text{on } \operatorname{ran}(P) \oplus \ker(P),
      \]  
      where \(\sigma(T_0) = \sigma_0\) and \(\sigma(T_1) = \sigma(T) \setminus \sigma_0\).</li>
  <li><strong>Analyticity:</strong> \(P\) depends analytically on \(T\) in a neighborhood of \(T\) in operator norm.</li>
  <li><strong>Finite-dimensional case:</strong> If \(\sigma_0\) consists of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, \(P\) projects onto the corresponding generalised eigenspace.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intuition:</h3>

<p>Think of the Riesz projection as an **infinite-dimensional analogue of projecting onto the eigenspace of selected eigenvalues**. The contour integral picks out the part of the operator associated only with \(\sigma_0\), separating it from the rest of the spectrum.</p>

</details>









<h2> 42: Riesz Decomposition Theorem</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(T: X \to X\) be a bounded linear operator on a Banach space \(X\). Suppose \(\sigma_0 \subset \sigma(T)\) is an isolated part of the spectrum, and let \(P\) be the Riesz projection corresponding to \(\sigma_0\). State and prove the <strong>Riesz decomposition theorem</strong> for \(X\) with respect to \(\sigma_0\).</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes / Proof Sketch</strong></summary>

<h3>Theorem (Riesz Decomposition):</h3>

<p>Let \(T: X \to X\) be bounded and \(\sigma_0 \subset \sigma(T)\) an isolated spectral set. Let \(P\) be the corresponding Riesz projection. Then:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Direct sum decomposition:</strong>  
  \[
  X = \operatorname{ran}(P) \oplus \ker(P),
  \]  
  where \(\operatorname{ran}(P)\) and \(\ker(P)\) are closed, \(T\)-invariant subspaces.</li>

  <li><strong>Restricted spectra:</strong>  
  \(\sigma(T|_{\operatorname{ran}(P)}) = \sigma_0\),  
  \(\sigma(T|_{\ker(P)}) = \sigma(T) \setminus \sigma_0\).</li>

  <li><strong>Operator decomposition:</strong>  
  \[
  T = T_0 \oplus T_1, \quad T_0 = T|_{\operatorname{ran}(P)}, \quad T_1 = T|_{\ker(P)}.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<h3>Proof Sketch:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1 – Define Riesz projection:</strong>  
  \[
  P = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\Gamma} (zI - T)^{-1} dz,
  \]  
  where \(\Gamma\) encloses \(\sigma_0\) but no other part of \(\sigma(T)\).</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2 – Show \(P\) is a projection:</strong>  
  By the properties of contour integrals and the resolvent, \(P^2 = P\) and \(PT = TP\). Hence \(\operatorname{ran}(P)\) and \(\ker(P)\) are \(T\)-invariant.</li>

  <li><strong>Step 3 – Decompose \(X\):</strong>  
  Every \(x \in X\) can be written uniquely as  
  \[
  x = Px + (I-P)x \in \operatorname{ran}(P) \oplus \ker(P).
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Step 4 – Restrict operator:</strong>  
  On \(\operatorname{ran}(P)\), the resolvent formula shows that the spectrum is exactly \(\sigma_0\). On \(\ker(P)\), by construction, the spectrum is \(\sigma(T) \setminus \sigma_0\).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Remark / Intuition:</h3>

<p>This theorem generalises **finite-dimensional spectral decomposition**: it “isolates” the part of the operator associated with a selected set of eigenvalues, even in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Riesz projections allow us to study these parts separately, which is especially useful in perturbation theory and spectral analysis.</p>

</details>







<h2>Unbounded Operators on Hilert Space</h2>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Domain is crucial:</strong> An unbounded operator \(T\) is a linear map \(T: D(T) \subset H \to H\), where \(D(T)\) is a dense subspace of \(H\). Unlike bounded operators, the domain is not necessarily all of \(H\).</li>
  <li><strong>Closed operators:</strong> \(T\) is closed if its graph \(\mathcal{G}(T) = \{(x, Tx) : x \in D(T)\}\) is closed in \(H \oplus H\).</li>
  <li><strong>Closable operators:</strong> \(T\) is closable if it has a closed extension \(\overline{T}\), i.e., the closure of the graph \(\mathcal{G}(T)\) is itself a graph of an operator.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 43: Closed and Closable Operators</h3>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(T: D(T) \subset H \to H\) be a densely defined linear operator. Prove the following proposition:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Proposition:</strong> \(T\) is closable if and only if for every sequence \((x_n) \subset D(T)\) with \(x_n \to 0\) and \(Tx_n \to y \in H\), we have \(y = 0\).</li>
  <li>Show that if \(T\) is closed, then it is automatically closable.</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your proof here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof Sketch</strong></summary>

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1 – Necessity:</strong>  
  Suppose \(T\) is closable with closure \(\overline{T}\). If \(x_n \to 0\) and \(Tx_n \to y\), then \((0, y) \in \mathcal{G}(\overline{T})\). Since \(\overline{T}\) is closed, its graph is closed, and the only element with 0 in the first component is 0 in the second. Hence \(y = 0\).</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2 – Sufficiency:</strong>  
  Suppose the condition holds. Let \(\mathcal{G}(\overline{T})\) be the closure of \(\mathcal{G}(T)\) in \(H \oplus H\). Define \(\overline{T}\) on the set of all \(x \in H\) such that \((x, y) \in \mathcal{G}(\overline{T})\). The uniqueness condition ensures that \(\overline{T}\) is well-defined and closed.</li>

  <li><strong>Step 3 – Closed implies closable:</strong>  
  If \(T\) is closed, then its graph is already closed, so trivially \(\overline{T} = T\). Hence every closed operator is closable.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This proposition gives a practical criterion to check whether a densely defined operator can be extended to a closed operator.</p>

</details>

<h3>Key Points: Self-Adjoint Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For symmetric operators \(T\) (\(\langle Tx, y \rangle = \langle x, Ty \rangle\) for all \(x, y \in D(T)\)), a key  is whether \(T\) admits a self-adjoint extension.</li>
  <li>Von Neumann’s theory: the existence of self-adjoint extensions is determined by the deficiency indices  
  \((n_+, n_-) = (\dim \ker(T^* - iI), \dim \ker(T^* + iI))\).</li>
  <li>If \(n_+ = n_-\), there exists a family of self-adjoint extensions of \(T\).</li>
  <li>Examples: The momentum operator \(P = -i d/dx\) on \(L^2([0,1])\) with domain \(C_c^\infty(0,1)\) is symmetric but not self-adjoint; proper boundary conditions yield self-adjoint extensions.</li>
</ul>


  










  <h2>Topological Vector Spaces (TVS)</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>A <strong>topological vector space</strong> is a vector space \(X\) over the field \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\) equipped with a topology \(\tau\) such that:</p>

<h2>Definition: Seminorm</h2>

<p>Let \(X\) be a vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\). A function \(p: X \to [0, \infty)\) is called a <strong>seminorm</strong> if it satisfies:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Absolute homogeneity:</strong> 
  \[
  p(\alpha x) = |\alpha| \, p(x) \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{F}, \, x \in X.
  \]</li>
  
  <li><strong>Subadditivity (triangle inequality):</strong> 
  \[
  p(x + y) \le p(x) + p(y) \quad \forall x, y \in X.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Unlike a norm, a seminorm may satisfy \(p(x) = 0\) for some non-zero \(x \in X\). If \(p(x) = 0 \implies x = 0\), then \(p\) is a norm.</p>










  
<h2> 44: Locally Convex Topological Vector Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \((X, \tau)\) be a topological vector space. Define what it means for the topology \(\tau\) to be <strong>locally convex</strong> and explain the characterisation in terms of seminorms.</p>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<h3>Definition / characterisation:</h3>

<p>The topology \(\tau\) on \(X\) is <strong>locally convex</strong> if there exists a neighborhood base of \(0 \in X\) consisting of **convex sets**. Equivalently, \(\tau\) is locally convex if it can be generated by a family of seminorms \(\{p_i\}_{i \in I}\), meaning the open sets in \(X\) are unions of sets of the form:</p>

\[
U = \big\{ x \in X : p_{i_1}(x - x_0) < \epsilon_1, \dots, p_{i_n}(x - x_0) < \epsilon_n \big\}
\]

<p>for some finite collection of seminorms \(p_{i_1}, \dots, p_{i_n}\), \(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n > 0\), and \(x_0 \in X\).  

In other words, \(U \subset X\) is open if for every \(x \in U\), there exist finitely many seminorms \(p_{i_1}, \dots, p_{i_n}\) and \(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n > 0\) such that:</p>

\[
\{y \in X : p_{i_k}(y - x) < \epsilon_k, \, k = 1, \dots, n \} \subset U.
\]

<h3>Remarks:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every normed space is locally convex because the norm itself is a seminorm and generates convex balls.</li>
  <li>Locally convex spaces are the natural setting for the **Hahn–Banach theorem** and for studying **dual spaces** in functional analysis.</li>
  <li>Convexity of neighborhoods ensures good separation properties and allows the use of continuous linear functionals to study the topology.</li>

<h2> 45: metrisability of a Topological Space</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean for a topological space \((X, \tau)\) to be <strong>metrisable</strong>?</p>

<textarea rows="4" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<p>A topological space \((X, \tau)\) is said to be <strong>metrisable</strong> if there exists a metric \(d: X \times X \to [0, \infty)\) such that the topology induced by \(d\) coincides with \(\tau\).  

Equivalently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open sets in \((X, \tau)\) are exactly the unions of open balls \(B_d(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x,y) < r\}\) for \(x \in X\) and \(r > 0\).</li>
  <li>Every metrisable space is a Hausdorff space, and sequences behave nicely with respect to convergence (sequential convergence characterises the topology).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> In locally convex spaces, metrisability often requires the topology to be generated by a <em>countable</em> family of seminorms.</p>

</details>







<h2> 46: Fréchet Spaces</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>A <strong>Fréchet space</strong> is a topological vector space \((X, \tau)\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\) satisfying:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Locally convex:</strong> \(\tau\) has a neighborhood base of 0 consisting of convex sets (equivalently, the topology is generated by a family of seminorms \(\{p_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\)).</li>
  <li><strong>metrisable:</strong> There exists a translation-invariant metric \(d\) generating \(\tau\).</li>
  <li><strong>Complete:</strong> Every Cauchy sequence (with respect to the metric) converges in \(X\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Equivalently, a Fréchet space is a **complete, metrisable, locally convex topological vector space**.</p>

<h3>Key Properties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Can be described via a **countable family of seminorms** \(p_1, p_2, \dots\) such that a sequence \((x_n)\) converges if and only if \(p_k(x_n - x) \to 0\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\).</li>
  <li>All Banach spaces are Fréchet spaces (take the single norm as the seminorm family).</li>
  <li>Spaces of smooth functions \(C^\infty([0,1])\) with seminorms \(p_n(f) = \sup_{x \in [0,1]} |f^{(n)}(x)|\) are Fréchet spaces but not Banach.</li>
  <li>Fréchet spaces are **locally convex and complete**, making them suitable for functional analysis beyond Banach spaces.</li>
  <li>metrisability implies sequential methods can be used to study convergence, compactness, etc.</li>
</ul>





<h2> 47: LF Spaces (Limit of Fréchet Spaces)</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>An <strong>LF space</strong> is a topological vector space \(X\) that is the **inductive limit of a sequence of Fréchet spaces**: </p>

\[
X = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty X_n, \quad X_1 \subset X_2 \subset X_3 \subset \cdots
\]

where each \(X_n\) is a Fréchet space and the inclusion maps \(X_n \hookrightarrow X_{n+1}\) are continuous.  

The topology on \(X\) is the **finest locally convex topology** such that each inclusion \(X_n \to X\) is continuous.

<h3>Key Points / Properties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LF spaces are **locally convex** but generally **not metrisable** (unless the sequence stabilises at some \(X_n\)).</li>
  <li>They are **complete** if each \(X_n\) is complete (i.e., Fréchet).</li>
  <li>They allow the study of spaces that are “too big” to be Fréchet, e.g., spaces of **test functions**:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>\(\mathcal{D}(\Omega) = C_c^\infty(\Omega)\), the space of smooth functions with compact support on an open set \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), is an LF space.</li>
    <li>Used in **distribution theory**, because distributions are continuous linear functionals on LF spaces.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Sequential convergence is **more subtle**, often requiring the convergence to occur in some stage \(X_n\).</li>
</ul>







<h2> 48: Distribution Spaces</h2>

<h3>Definition: Space of Distributions</h3>

<p>Let \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be open. The space of test functions with compact support is denoted by:</p>

\[
\mathcal{D}(\Omega) := C_c^\infty(\Omega)
\]

<p>equipped with its standard <strong>LF topology</strong> (inductive limit of Fréchet spaces). Then the <strong>space of distributions</strong> on \(\Omega\) is defined as the topological dual:</p>

\[
\mathcal{D}'(\Omega) := \{ T: \mathcal{D}(\Omega) \to \mathbb{C} \mid T \text{ is linear and continuous} \}.
\]

<h3>Key Properties</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Locally convex:</strong> \(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) is a locally convex space as the dual of a locally convex space.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete:</strong> \(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) is complete in the weak-* topology (Banach–Alaoglu style argument for LF spaces).</li>
  <li><strong>Not normable:</strong> There is no single norm generating the topology; convergence is defined via seminorms or bounded sets in \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\).</li>
  <li><strong>Dual topologies:</strong> There are two important notions of convergence for distributions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weak-* topology:</strong> \(T_\alpha \to T\) if \(\langle T_\alpha, \phi \rangle \to \langle T, \phi \rangle\) for all \(\phi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)\). This is pointwise convergence on test functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong dual topology:</strong> Uniform convergence on bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\). Provides finer control, useful for continuity of operations like differentiation and convolution.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>LF nature of \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\) ensures distributions can act on “large” spaces, but convergence in \(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) can be subtle depending on the topology considered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) contains all locally integrable functions as regular distributions, i.e., \(f \mapsto T_f\) with \(T_f(\phi) = \int_\Omega f(x) \phi(x) dx\).</li>
  <li>The weak-* topology is useful for defining sequential convergence and continuity of linear functionals.</li>
  <li>The strong dual topology is necessary to guarantee continuity of operations that involve families of test functions simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Distribution spaces are a prototypical example of LF duals: **non-normable, complete, locally convex, and metrisable on bounded sets**.</li>
</ul>











  
<h2> 48: Duality in Locally Convex Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a locally convex space (LCS) over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\). Consider its continuous dual \(X'\) (the space of all continuous linear functionals on \(X\)).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the <strong>weak-* topology</strong) on \(X'\) and describe convergence in this topology.</li>
  <li>Define the <strong>strong dual topology</strong> on \(X'\) and explain how convergence differs from the weak-* topology.</li>
  <li>Explain why the strong dual is generally finer than the weak-* topology and give an example where the two topologies differ.</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<h3>1. Weak-* Topology on \(X'\)</h3>
<p>The <strong>weak-* topology</strong> on \(X'\) is the coarsest topology making all evaluation maps continuous:</p>

\[
\phi \mapsto \phi(x) \in \mathbb{F}, \quad \forall x \in X.
\]

<p>Convergence in the weak-* topology: a net \((\phi_\alpha) \subset X'\) converges to \(\phi \in X'\) if and only if</p>

\[
\phi_\alpha(x) \to \phi(x) \quad \forall x \in X.
\]

<p>Intuition: pointwise convergence on \(X\).</p>

<h3>2. Strong Dual Topology on \(X'\)</h3>
<p>The <strong>strong dual topology</strong> on \(X'\) is generated by the family of seminorms:</p>

\[
p_B(\phi) := \sup_{x \in B} |\phi(x)|, \quad \text{for all bounded sets } B \subset X.
\]

<p>Convergence in the strong dual: a net \((\phi_\alpha)\) converges to \(\phi\) if and only if it converges <em>uniformly on all bounded subsets of \(X\)</em>. This is stronger than pointwise convergence.</p>

<h3>3. Comparison and Example</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The strong dual topology is **finer** than the weak-* topology because uniform convergence on bounded sets implies pointwise convergence on individual elements.</li>
  <li>Example: Let \(X = \mathcal{D}(\Omega)\). Then \(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) with the weak-* topology is pointwise convergence on test functions, whereas the strong dual requires uniform convergence on bounded subsets. These topologies are not the same, but both make \(\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\) locally convex and complete.</li>
  <li>Key consequence: operations like differentiation or convolution are continuous in the strong dual topology but may fail to be continuous in the weak-* topology.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Weak-* = pointwise convergence, Strong = uniform on bounded sets. Strong dual is generally finer, capturing more “continuity control” over the LCS.</p>

<h2> 49: Barrelled and Bornological Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(X\) be a locally convex space (LCS). Define and explain the following classes of spaces:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Barrelled space:</strong> Define what it means for a locally convex space to be barrelled and explain the significance.</li>
  <li><strong>Bornological space:</strong> Define what it means for a locally convex space to be bornological and explain the significance.</li>
</ol>

<textarea rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<h3>1. Barrelled Spaces</h3>
<p>A locally convex space \(X\) is called <strong>barrelled</strong> if every <em>barrel</em> in \(X\) is a neighborhood of 0. A <strong>barrel</strong> is a subset of \(X\) that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Closed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Convex</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Balanced</strong> (absorbs scalar multiples with |α| ≤ 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Absorbing</strong> (for every x in X, there exists t > 0 such that x ∈ tB)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Significance:</strong> In barrelled spaces, every linear map from \(X\) to a Banach space that is **pointwise bounded** is automatically **continuous** (Banach–Steinhaus theorem / Uniform Boundedness Principle holds).</p>

<h3>2. Bornological Spaces</h3>
<p>A locally convex space \(X\) is called <strong>bornological</strong> if every bounded linear map from \(X\) into any locally convex space is automatically **continuous**. Equivalently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every bounded set in \(X\) is contained in the absolutely convex hull of some neighborhood of 0.</li>
  <li>Bornological spaces allow **boundedness to control continuity**, which is useful for unbounded operators and inductive limit spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples / Remarks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Every **Banach space** is barrelled and bornological.</li>
  <li>LF spaces, like \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\), are bornological but not necessarily barrelled.</li>
  <li>Barrelled vs bornological: barrelled controls continuity via **barrels (large sets)**, bornological controls continuity via **bounded sets**.</li>
</ul>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<p>A <strong>σ-algebra</strong> \(\mathcal{F}\) on a set \(X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) satisfying the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Non-empty:</strong> \(X \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
  <li><strong>Closed under complements:</strong> If \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(X \setminus A \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
  <li><strong>Closed under countable unions:</strong> If \(A_1, A_2, \dots \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>From these axioms, it follows that σ-algebras are also closed under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Countable intersections: \(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}\)</li>
  <li>Set differences: \(A \setminus B \in \mathcal{F}\) if \(A, B \in \mathcal{F}\)</li>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<p>A <strong>measure</strong> \(\mu\) on a measurable space \((X, \mathcal{F})\) is a function</p>

\[
\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]
\]

<p>that satisfies the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), \(\mu(A) \ge 0\).</li>

  <li><strong>Countable additivity (σ-additivity):</strong> For any countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets \(\{A_n\} \subset \mathcal{F}\),</li>
</ol>

\[
\mu\Big(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \Big) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)
\]

<p>From these axioms, it follows automatically that measures are:</p>

  <li><strong>Monotone:</strong> If \(A \subset B\), then \(\mu(A) \le \mu(B)\).</li>
  <li><strong>Countably subadditive:</strong> For any countable collection \(\{A_n\} \subset \mathcal{F}\),</li>

<h2> 52: Lebesgue Integral – Definition and Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \((X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\) be a measure space and \(f: X \to \mathbb{R}\) a measurable function. Describe the steps to define the Lebesgue integral of \(f\), including how to handle positive and negative parts.</p>

<textarea rows="10" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Answer</strong></summary>

<h3>Steps to Define the Lebesgue Integral</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Non-negative simple functions:</strong>  
  Start with a measurable function \(\phi: X \to [0, \infty)\) that takes only finitely many values (simple function).  
  Define the integral:</li>

\[
\int_X \phi \, d\mu := \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \, \mu(A_i)
\]

where \(\phi = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \chi_{A_i}\) and \(A_i\) are measurable, pairwise disjoint sets.

  <li><strong>Step 2: Extend to non-negative measurable functions:</strong>  
  For \(f \ge 0\) measurable, define</li>

\[
\int_X f \, d\mu := \sup \left\{ \int_X \phi \, d\mu : 0 \le \phi \le f, \, \phi \text{ simple} \right\}.
\]

  <li><strong>Step 3: Split general measurable functions:</strong>  
  For a real-valued \(f\), write</li>

\[
f = f^+ - f^- \quad \text{where} \quad f^+ = \max(f,0), \quad f^- = \max(-f,0).
\]

Define

\[
\int_X f \, d\mu := \int_X f^+ \, d\mu - \int_X f^- \, d\mu,
\]

provided at least one of \(\int_X f^+ d\mu\) or \(\int_X f^- d\mu\) is finite.

  <li><strong>Step 4: Absolute integrability:</strong>  
  \(f\) is called integrable if \(\int_X |f| \, d\mu < \infty\). Then the integral is well-defined and finite.
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Lebesgue integration starts from simple non-negative functions, extends to all non-negative measurable functions by supremum, then splits a general function into positive and negative parts.</p>

<h2> 53: Fundamental Theorems of Lebesgue Integration</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT)</li>
  <li>Fatou’s Lemma</li>
  <li>Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<h3>1. Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT)</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \((f_n)\) be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions on \(X\) such that \(f_n \uparrow f\) pointwise (i.e., \(f_1 \le f_2 \le \dots\) and \(f_n \to f\)). Then</p>

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
\]

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Since \(f_n \le f\), the sequence \(\int f_n d\mu\) is **monotone increasing** and bounded above by \(\int f d\mu\) (possibly \(+\infty\)).</li>
  <li>By the definition of the Lebesgue integral for non-negative functions,</li>

\[
\int_X f \, d\mu = \sup \left\{ \int_X \phi \, d\mu : 0 \le \phi \le f, \phi \text{ simple} \right\}.
\]

  <li>Given any simple function \(\phi \le f\), there exists \(N\) such that \(\phi \le f_n\) for all \(n \ge N\). Hence, \(\int \phi \le \int f_n\).</li>
  <li>Taking supremum over all \(\phi\), we get \(\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_n = \int f\).</li>
</ol>

---

<h3>2. Fatou’s Lemma</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \((f_n)\) be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions. Then</p>

\[
\int_X \liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n \, d\mu \le \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu.
\]

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Define \(g_k := \inf_{n \ge k} f_n \). Then \(g_k \uparrow \liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n\).</li>
  <li>Apply MCT to \(g_k\):</li>
  
\[
\int_X \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n \, d\mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \int_X g_k \, d\mu.
\]

  <li>For each \(k\), \(g_k \le f_n\) for all \(n \ge k\), hence \(\int g_k \le \inf_{n \ge k} \int f_n\).</li>
  <li>Take \(k \to \infty\), then \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \int g_k \le \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int f_n\), proving Fatou's lemma.</li>
</ol>

---

<h3>3. Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT)</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \((f_n)\) be a sequence of measurable functions such that \(f_n \to f\) pointwise and there exists an **integrable function** \(g \ge 0\) with \(|f_n| \le g\) for all \(n\). Then \(f\) is integrable and</p>

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
\]

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Define \(h_n := g - f_n\) and \(k_n := g + f_n\), which are non-negative and satisfy \(h_n \to g - f\), \(k_n \to g + f\).</li>
  <li>Apply Fatou's lemma to \(h_n\) and \(k_n\):</li>

\[
\int_X (g - f) \, d\mu \le \liminf \int_X (g - f_n) \, d\mu, \quad
\int_X (g + f) \, d\mu \le \liminf \int_X (g + f_n) \, d\mu.
\]

  <li>Rewriting gives:</li>

\[
\limsup \int_X f_n \le \int_X f \le \liminf \int_X f_n.
\]

  <li>Hence \(\lim \int f_n = \int f\), proving DCT.</li>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> For \(f, g \in L^p(X, \mu)\), \(1 \le p < \infty\),</p>

\[
\|f + g\|_p \le \|f\|_p + \|g\|_p.

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For \(p = 1\), obvious from linearity of integral.</li>
  <li>For \(1 < p < \infty\), write</li>

\[
\|f + g\|_p^p = \int_X |f + g|^p \, d\mu.

  <li>Use the convexity inequality: \(|f + g|^p \le |f| |f + g|^{p-1} + |g| |f + g|^{p-1}\).</li>
  <li>Apply Hölder’s inequality to each term with exponents \(p\) and \(q\):</li>

\[
\int_X |f| |f + g|^{p-1} \le \|f\|_p \, \||f + g|^{p-1}\|_q = \|f\|_p \, \|f + g\|_p^{p-1},

and similarly for \(g\).  

  <li>Combine terms: \(\|f + g\|_p^p \le (\|f\|_p + \|g\|_p) \|f + g\|_p^{p-1} \implies \|f + g\|_p \le \|f\|_p + \|g\|_p\).</li>

<h2>Duality of L<sup>p</sup> Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \((X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\) be a measure space, and let \(1 < p < \infty\) with conjugate exponent \(q\) defined by \(1/p + 1/q = 1\). Describe the dual space of \(L^p(X, \mu)\) and prove it.</p>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<h3>Proposition (Dual of L<sup>p</sup>):</h3>

<p>For \(1 < p < \infty\), the dual space \((L^p(X, \mu))^*\) is isometrically isomorphic to \(L^q(X, \mu)\). Explicitly, for each \(g \in L^q\), the linear functional</p>

\[
\Lambda_g(f) := \int_X f(x) g(x) \, d\mu
\]

is continuous on \(L^p\) with operator norm \(\|\Lambda_g\| = \|g\|_q\), and every continuous linear functional on \(L^p\) arises this way.

---

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Linearity and boundedness:</strong>  
  For \(f \in L^p\), define \(\Lambda_g(f) = \int f g \, d\mu\).  
  By Hölder’s inequality:</li>

\[
|\Lambda_g(f)| = \left|\int_X f g \, d\mu\right| \le \|f\|_p \, \|g\|_q,
\]

so \(\Lambda_g\) is continuous with \(\|\Lambda_g\| \le \|g\|_q\).

  <li><strong>Step 2: Norm equality:</strong>  
  Take \(f = \frac{|g|^{q-1} \operatorname{sgn}(g)}{\|g\|_q^{q/p}} \in L^p\) (normalised), then  

\[
|\Lambda_g(f)| = \|g\|_q.
\]

Thus \(\|\Lambda_g\| = \|g\|_q\).

  <li><strong>Step 3: Surjectivity:</strong>  
  Let \(\Lambda \in (L^p)^*\). Using the **Radon–Nikodym theorem**, there exists \(g \in L^q\) such that  

\[
\Lambda(f) = \int_X f g \, d\mu \quad \forall f \in L^p.
\]

  <li>Hence every continuous linear functional on \(L^p\) is represented by some \(g \in L^q\), completing the duality.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> \((L^p(X, \mu))^* \cong L^q(X, \mu)\) isometrically, which is fundamental in functional analysis for understanding bounded linear functionals, reflexivity of \(L^p\) spaces, and weak convergence.</p>

  <h2> 54: Radon–Nikodym Theorem</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(\nu\) and \(\mu\) be σ-finite measures on \((X, \mathcal{F})\) with \(\nu \ll \mu\) (ν absolutely continuous w.r.t μ). Prove that there exists a measurable function \(f: X \to [0, \infty)\) such that</p>

\[
\nu(E) = \int_E f \, d\mu \quad \forall E \in \mathcal{F}.

  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof Sketch</strong></summary>

<h3>Theorem (Radon–Nikodym):</h3>

<p>If \(\nu \ll \mu\) are σ-finite measures, there exists a unique \(f \in L^1(\mu)\) such that</p>

\[
\nu(E) = \int_E f \, d\mu \quad \forall E \in \mathcal{F}.
\]

The function \(f\) is called the <strong>Radon–Nikodym derivative</strong> of ν with respect to μ, denoted \(f = \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\).</p>

---

<h3>Proof Sketch:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1: σ-finite reduction:</strong>  
  Write \(X = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty X_n\) with \(\mu(X_n), \nu(X_n) < \infty\). It suffices to construct \(f\) on each \(X_n\) and then glue them together.</li>

  <li><strong>Step 2: Define candidate function:</strong>  
  Consider the set of all non-negative measurable functions \(\phi\) with  
  \(\int_E \phi \, d\mu \le \nu(E)\) for all measurable \(E\). Let  
  \[
  f := \sup \{ \phi : \phi \le \nu \text{ in this sense} \}.
  \]  

  <li><strong>Step 3: Use monotone convergence:</strong>  
  Construct an increasing sequence \(\phi_n \uparrow f\). By Monotone Convergence Theorem,  
  \[
  \int_E f \, d\mu = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \phi_n \, d\mu \le \nu(E).
  \]  

  <li><strong>Step 4: Maximality argument:</strong>  
  If there existed a set \(A\) with \(\int_A f \, d\mu < \nu(A)\), one could increase \(f\) on \(A\) to contradict the definition of \(f\) as a supremum. Hence equality holds:  
  \[
  \int_E f \, d\mu = \nu(E) \quad \forall E.
  \]

  <li><strong>Step 5: Uniqueness:</strong>  
  If \(g\) also satisfies \(\int_E g \, d\mu = \nu(E)\), then \(\int_E (f-g) \, d\mu = 0\) for all \(E\), implying \(f = g\) μ-a.e.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Radon–Nikodym derivative \(f = \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\) exists, is unique μ-a.e., and allows expressing any absolutely continuous measure w.r.t μ as an integral against μ.</p>

<h2> 55: Weak Convergence in L<sup>p</sup> Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Define weak convergence in \(L^p(X, \mu)\) for \(1 < p < \infty\), state its key properties, and give an illustrative example.</p>

<textarea rows="12" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<h3>Definition:</h3>

<p>A sequence \((f_n) \subset L^p(X, \mu)\) is said to <strong>converge weakly</strong> to \(f \in L^p(X, \mu)\), denoted \(f_n \rightharpoonup f\), if</p>

\[
\int_X f_n(x) g(x) \, d\mu \longrightarrow \int_X f(x) g(x) \, d\mu \quad \forall g \in L^q(X, \mu),
\]

where \(q\) is the conjugate exponent of \(p\) (\(1/p + 1/q = 1\)).

---

<h3>Key Properties:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Weak convergence implies boundedness in norm: \(\sup_n \|f_n\|_p < \infty\).</li>
  <li>Weak limits are unique.</li>
  <li>Norm is lower semicontinuous under weak convergence:  
  \(\|f\|_p \le \liminf_{n \to \infty} \|f_n\|_p\).</li>
  <li>Every bounded sequence in \(L^p\), \(1 < p < \infty\), has a weakly convergent subsequence (Banach–Alaoglu theorem + reflexivity).</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Let \(X = [0,1]\), \(f_n(x) = \sin(2 \pi n x)\) in \(L^2([0,1])\). Then \(\|f_n\|_2 = 1\), but for any \(g \in L^2([0,1])\),</p>

\[
\int_0^1 f_n(x) g(x) \, dx \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
\]

<p>Hence \(f_n \rightharpoonup 0\) weakly, but \(\|f_n - 0\|_2 = 1 \not\to 0\).  
Intuition: weak convergence tests only against linear functionals (duals), not full norms.</p>

<h2>56: Advanced Spectral Theory: Unbounded Operators</h2>

<h3>1. Spectral Measure for Self-Adjoint Operators</h3>

<p>Let \(B(\mathbb{R})\) denote the Borel σ-algebra of \(\mathbb{R}\). A <strong>spectral measure</strong> associated with a self-adjoint operator \(T\) is a map</p>

\[
E : B(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{B}(H) \quad \text{(bounded operators on } H)
\]

satisfying:

<ol>
  <li>Projection-valued: \(E(B)\) is an orthogonal projection for each Borel set \(B \subset \mathbb{R}\).</li>
  <li>Countable additivity: for disjoint \(B_1, B_2, \dots \in B(\mathbb{R})\),  
  \(\sum_n E(B_n) = E(\bigcup_n B_n)\) (strong operator topology).</li>
  <li>Normalisation: \(E(\mathbb{R}) = I\), the identity operator.</li>
  <li>Compatibility with \(T\): for \(x, y \in D(T)\),  
  \(\langle x, T y \rangle = \int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, d \langle x, E(\lambda) y \rangle\).</li>
</ol>

---

<h3>2. Spectral Theorem (Unbounded Case)</h3>

<p>Let \(T\) be self-adjoint on \(H\). Then there exists a unique spectral measure \(E\) such that</p>

\[
T = \int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, dE(\lambda),
\]

in the sense that for all \(x \in D(T)\), the integral  
\(\int_\mathbb{R} \lambda^2 \, d\|E(\lambda)x\|^2 < \infty\) and

\[
\langle x, T x \rangle = \int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, d\|E(\lambda)x\|^2.
\]

<p>This generalises the diagonalisation of bounded self-adjoint operators to unbounded operators.</p>

---

<h3>3. Properties of the Spectral Measure \(E\)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support of \(E\) equals the spectrum of \(T\): \(\sigma(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{R} : E(U) \neq 0 \ \forall U \ni \lambda \}\).</li>
  <li>Functional calculus: For any Borel function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}\),  
  \[
  f(T) := \int_\mathbb{R} f(\lambda) \, dE(\lambda)
  \]  
  defines a (possibly unbounded) operator on \(H\).</li>
  <li>Strongly commuting projections: \(E(B_1) E(B_2) = E(B_1 \cap B_2)\).</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>4. Intuition:</h3>

<p>Think of \(E(B)\) as “projecting onto the subspace of vectors with spectral values in \(B\).”  
Unbounded operators (like momentum or position in quantum mechanics) are not bounded, but the spectral theorem allows a **rigorous decomposition** into “generalised eigenvectors” via the spectral measure.</p>

<h3>1. Partition of the spectrum:</h3>

<p>Let \(\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb{R}\) be the spectrum of \(T\). Choose a partition</p>

\[
-\infty < \lambda_0 < \lambda_1 < \dots < \lambda_n < \infty
\]

of the real line (or a bounded interval containing the spectrum). For each subinterval \([\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k)\), pick a sample point \(\xi_k \in [\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k)\).</p>

<h3>2. Operator-valued Riemann sum:</h3>

<p>The Riemann sum approximating the spectral integral is</p>

\[
S_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \xi_k \, E([\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k)).
\]

<p>Here each term \(\xi_k E([\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k))\) is a bounded operator on \(H\), and the sum \(S_n\) is also an operator on \(H\).</p>

---

<h3>3. Limit to spectral integral:</h3>

<p>The spectral integral is defined as the limit (in the strong operator topology or in norm if bounded):</p>

\[
\int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, dE(\lambda) := \lim_{\| \Delta \| \to 0} \sum_{k=1}^n \xi_k E([\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k)),
\]

where \(\| \Delta \| = \max_k (\lambda_k - \lambda_{k-1})\) is the mesh of the partition.</p>

<p>This is analogous to the classical Riemann integral, but each “area element” is replaced by a **projection operator multiplied by the sample point**.</p>

<h3>4. Intuition:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Think of \(E([\lambda_{k-1}, \lambda_k))\) as projecting onto the subspace of \(H\) corresponding to spectral values in that interval.</li>
  <li>The Riemann sum approximates \(T\) by summing the contributions from each spectral slice.</li>

<h3>Definition:</h3>

<p>A linear operator \(A : D(A) \subset H \to H\) is called <strong>bounded</strong> if there exists a constant \(M \ge 0\) such that</p>

\[
\|A x\| \le M \|x\|, \quad \forall x \in D(A).
\]

<p>If no such \(M\) exists or \(D(A) \neq H\), the operator is called <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p>

<h3>Proposition:</h3>

<p>\(A\) is unbounded \(\iff\) for every \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), there exists \(x_n \in D(A)\) such that \(\|A x_n\| > n \|x_n\|\).</p>

---

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>(⇒) Suppose \(A\) is unbounded:</strong>  
  By definition, no \(M\) exists such that \(\|A x\| \le M \|x\|\) for all \(x \in D(A)\).  
  Therefore, for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), the inequality \(\|A x\| \le n \|x\|\) must fail for some \(x_n \in D(A)\).  
  That is, \(\|A x_n\| > n \|x_n\|\).</li>

  <li><strong>(⇐) Conversely, suppose for each \(n\) there exists \(x_n\) with \(\|A x_n\| > n \|x_n\|\):</strong>  
  If \(A\) were bounded, there would exist \(M \ge 0\) such that \(\|A x\| \le M \|x\|\) for all \(x \in D(A)\).  
  Choosing \(n > M\) gives a contradiction: \(\|A x_n\| > n \|x_n\| > M \|x_n\|\).  
  Hence, \(A\) is unbounded.</li>

<h2>63: Spectral Radius</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let \(A\) be a Banach algebra element. What is its spectral radius and how can it be expressed?</p>

<textarea rows="4" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<h3>Definition:</h3>

<p>The <strong>spectral radius</strong> of an element \(a \in A\) is</p>

\[
r(a) := \sup \{ |\lambda| : \lambda \in \sigma(a) \},
\]

where \(\sigma(a)\) is the <strong>spectrum</strong> of \(a\), i.e., all \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) such that \(a - \lambda 1\) is not invertible in \(A\).</p>

<h3>Key Expression (Spectral Radius Formula):</h3>

\[
r(a) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|a^n\|^{1/n}.
\]

<p>This gives a way to compute or estimate the spectral radius using powers of \(a\) in the Banach algebra.</p>

<textarea rows="6" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Proof</strong></summary>

<h3>Theorem (Gelfand-Mazur):</h3>

<p>If \(A\) is a unital Banach algebra over \(\mathbb{C}\) in which every non-zero element is invertible, then \(A \cong \mathbb{C}\); that is, \(A\) is **isometrically isomorphic to the complex numbers**.</p>

---

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(a \in A\) be arbitrary. Since \(a \neq 0 \implies a\) is invertible, the spectrum \(\sigma(a)\) cannot contain \(0\).</li>

  <li>In a unital Banach algebra, the spectrum \(\sigma(a)\) is **non-empty** for any \(a \in A\) (standard spectral theorem for Banach algebras).</li>

  <li>Thus, \(\sigma(a)\) must consist of a **single non-zero complex number** \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\).</li>

  <li>Consider \(b := a - \lambda 1\). Then \(\sigma(b) = \sigma(a - \lambda 1) = \sigma(a) - \lambda = \{0\}\), so \(b\) is **not invertible**.</li>

  <li>But by assumption, **every non-zero element is invertible**, so \(b = 0 \implies a = \lambda 1\).</li>

  <li>Since \(a\) was arbitrary, every element in \(A\) is a scalar multiple of the identity. Therefore, \(A \cong \mathbb{C}\).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A unital Banach algebra in which all non-zero elements are invertible is necessarily **one-dimensional** and isomorphic to \(\mathbb{C}\).</p>

<h3>Theorem (Gelfand Representation):</h3>

satisfies:

<ol>
  <li>\(\Gamma\) is a **continuous algebra homomorphism**.</li>

<h3>Significance:</h3>

<h3>Definition:</h3>

<p>A <strong>C*-algebra</strong> \(A\) is a Banach algebra over \(\mathbb{C}\) equipped with an involution \( * : A \to A\) (conjugate-linear, \((ab)^* = b^* a^*, (a^*)^* = a\)) such that:</p>

  <li>\(\|a^* a\| = \|a\|^2\) for all \(a \in A\) (C*-identity).</li>
  <li>It is a Banach algebra: complete normed algebra with sub-multiplicative norm.</li>
</ol>

---

<h3>Key Consequences:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gelfand-Naimark Theorem:</strong> Every commutative unital C*-algebra \(A\) is *-isomorphic to \(C(X)\), the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space \(X\) (its spectrum / character space).</li>

  <li><strong>Self-adjoint elements:</strong> Elements \(a = a^*\) have **real spectrum**, i.e., \(\sigma(a) \subset \mathbb{R}\).</li>

  <li><strong>Norm via spectrum:</strong> For any \(a \in A\), \(\|a\| = r(a)\) if \(a\) is normal (\(aa^* = a^* a\)), so the spectral radius equals the operator norm.</li>

  <li><strong>Functional calculus:</strong> For normal elements \(a \in A\), any continuous function \(f\) on \(\sigma(a)\) defines an element \(f(a) \in A\), extending polynomials to continuous functions.</li>

  <li><strong>Representation on Hilbert space:</strong> Every C*-algebra can be represented as a norm-closed *-subalgebra of \(B(H)\), the bounded operators on some Hilbert space \(H\) (Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction).</li>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<h3>Theorem (Gelfand–Naimark):</h3>

<p>Every C*-algebra \(A\) is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed *-subalgebra of \(B(H)\), the bounded operators on some Hilbert space \(H\).  
In other words, every abstract C*-algebra can be represented concretely as operators on a Hilbert space.</p>

---

<h3>Proof Outline:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Let \(A\) be a C*-algebra. Consider the set of all **positive linear functionals** \(\phi: A \to \mathbb{C}\) (states).</li>

  <li>For each \(\phi\), construct the **GNS representation** \((\pi_\phi, H_\phi, \xi_\phi)\) as described in the previous section.</li>

  <li>Take the **direct sum** of all GNS representations:  
  \[
  \pi := \bigoplus_\phi \pi_\phi : A \to B\Big(\bigoplus_\phi H_\phi\Big)
  \]  
  This is a *-representation of \(A\) on a (possibly large) Hilbert space.</li>

  <li>\(\pi\) is **injective (faithful)**: if \(a \neq 0\), there exists a positive linear functional \(\phi\) such that \(\phi(a^* a) > 0\), hence \(\pi_\phi(a) \neq 0\).  
  Therefore, \(\pi(a) \neq 0\).</li>

  <li>The image \(\pi(A)\) is a **norm-closed *-subalgebra** of \(B(\bigoplus_\phi H_\phi)\), and \(\pi\) preserves the *-algebra structure and the norm (\(\|\pi(a)\| = \|a\|\)).</li>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<h3>Theorem (Banach Fixed Point / Contraction Mapping):</h3>

<p>Let \((X, d)\) be a **complete metric space** and \(T: X \to X\) a **contraction**, i.e., there exists \(0 \le k < 1\) such that:</p>

\[
d(T(x), T(y)) \le k \, d(x, y) \quad \forall x, y \in X.
\]

Then:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There exists a **unique fixed point** \(x^* \in X\) such that \(T(x^*) = x^*\).</li>
  <li>For any \(x_0 \in X\), the sequence \(x_{n+1} = T(x_n)\) converges to \(x^*\) with estimate:  
  \[
  d(x_n, x^*) \le \frac{k^n}{1-k} d(x_1, x_0).
  \]</li>
</ol>

---

<h3>Proof:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Construct the iterative sequence:</strong> Choose \(x_0 \in X\), define \(x_{n+1} = T(x_n)\).</li>

  <li><strong>Show Cauchy property:</strong>  
  For \(n > m\):
  \[
  d(x_n, x_m) \le d(x_n, x_{n-1}) + \dots + d(x_{m+1}, x_m) 
  \le d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{j=m}^{n-1} k^j
  \le \frac{k^m}{1-k} d(x_1, x_0).
  \]  
  As \(m \to \infty\), \(d(x_n, x_m) \to 0\). Hence \((x_n)\) is **Cauchy**.</li>

  <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Since \(X\) is complete, \(x_n \to x^* \in X\).</li>

  <li><strong>Fixed point property:</strong>  
  By continuity of \(T\) (follows from contraction):
  \[
  T(x^*) = T\Big(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n\Big) = \lim_{n \to \infty} T(x_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n+1} = x^*.
  \]</li>

  <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Suppose \(y^*\) is another fixed point:
  \[
  d(x^*, y^*) = d(T(x^*), T(y^*)) \le k \, d(x^*, y^*).
  \]  
  Since \(0 \le k < 1\), this implies \(d(x^*, y^*) = 0 \Rightarrow x^* = y^*\).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Every contraction on a complete metric space has a **unique fixed point**, and iterating the map converges to it. This theorem is fundamental in proving **existence and uniqueness** in ODEs, integral equations, and functional analysis.</p>

<h3>Theorem (Schauder Fixed Point):</h3>

<p>Let \(C\) be a **non-empty, convex, compact subset** of a Banach space \(X\).  
Let \(T: C \to C\) be **continuous**. Then \(T\) has at least **one fixed point** in \(C\), i.e., there exists \(x^* \in C\) such that:</p>

\[
T(x^*) = x^*.
\]

---

<h3>Proof Outline:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Finite-dimensional approximation:</strong> By compactness, for any \(n\) there exists a finite-dimensional subspace \(X_n \subset X\) and a continuous map \(P_n: C \to X_n \cap C\) that approximates the identity (projection onto finite-dimensional slices).</li>

  <li><strong>Apply Brouwer in finite dimension:</strong>  
  \(T_n := P_n \circ T: X_n \cap C \to X_n \cap C\) is continuous on a convex, compact subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).  
  By **Brouwer’s fixed point theorem**, \(T_n\) has a fixed point \(x_n \in X_n \cap C\).</li>

  <li><strong>Extract convergent subsequence:</strong>  
  Since \(C\) is compact, the sequence \((x_n)\) has a convergent subsequence \(x_{n_k} \to x^* \in C\).</li>

  <li><strong>Pass to the limit:</strong>  
  Continuity of \(T\) gives:
  \[
  T(x^*) = \lim_{k \to \infty} T(x_{n_k}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} x_{n_k} = x^*.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Schauder’s theorem generalises **Brouwer’s fixed point theorem** to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces under compactness and convexity. It is widely used for proving existence of solutions in **integral equations, PDEs, and nonlinear functional analysis**.</p>

  <li>Multiply by a **test function** \(v\) from a suitable space (e.g., \(H_0^1(\Omega)\)) and integrate over the domain \(\Omega\):  
  \[

  \]</li>
  <li>Apply **integration by parts** to move derivatives off \(u\) (reduces smoothness requirements):

 <h4>Direct Method (Calculus of Variations):</h4>

<p>Let \(X\) be a reflexive Banach space, and let \(J: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}\) be a functional. Suppose:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(J\) is **coercive**: \(\|u\|_X \to \infty \implies J(u) \to +\infty\).</li>
  <li>\(J\) is **weakly lower semi-continuous**: \(u_n \rightharpoonup u \implies J(u) \le \liminf J(u_n)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Then **\(J\) attains its minimum**: there exists \(u^* \in X\) such that  
\[
J(u^*) = \inf_{u \in X} J(u).
\]</p>

  <h4>Proof Outline:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Take a minimising sequence \((u_n)\) such that \(J(u_n) \to \inf J\).</li>
  <li>Coercivity ensures \((u_n)\) is **bounded** in \(X\).</li>
  <li>Reflexivity of \(X\) implies there exists a **weakly convergent subsequence** \(u_{n_k} \rightharpoonup u^*\).</li>
  <li>Weak lower semi-continuity gives:  
  \[
  J(u^*) \le \liminf_{k \to \infty} J(u_{n_k}) = \inf J,

  <li>Using integration by parts and assuming smooth boundary conditions, the **Euler–Lagrange equation** is obtained:  
  \[
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d}{dx_i} \frac{\partial F}{\partial (\partial u / \partial x_i)} = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega.
  \]</li>
</ol>

<p>Key point: E-L equations give the **strong form** corresponding to a variational problem.</p>

  <summary><strong>Solution / Notes</strong></summary>

<p><strong>Weak Compactness Method:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Used in **infinite-dimensional variational problems** where direct minimisation may fail in norm topology.</li>
  <li>Key idea: If \(X\) is a **reflexive Banach space**, every bounded sequence has a **weakly convergent subsequence**.</li>
  <li>Combine **weak convergence + weak lower semi-continuity** of the functional to extract a **minimiser** in the weak sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is widely used in **nonlinear PDEs** where compactness in norm is unavailable.</p>

<h4>Rellich–Kondrachov Compactness Theorem:</h4>

<p>Let \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be bounded with Lipschitz boundary. For \(1 \le p < \infty\) and \(1 \le q < p^*\) (Sobolev conjugate):</p>

\[
H_0^1(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^q(\Omega) \quad \text{is **compact**.}
\]

<p>Consequences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every bounded sequence in \(H_0^1(\Omega)\) has a **strongly convergent subsequence in \(L^q(\Omega)\)**.</li>
  <li>Used to pass to the limit in **nonlinear functionals** in variational methods.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Concentration-Compactness Principle (P.-L. Lions):</h4>

<p>Addresses **lack of compactness** due to translation or dilation in unbounded domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Given a bounded sequence in a function space, one of three phenomena occurs:</li>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Compactness:</strong> subsequence strongly converges.</li>
    <li><strong>Vanishing:</strong> mass spreads out, no limit.</li>
    <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> mass concentrates at points, possibly forming Dirac-type measures.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Allows **recovery of convergence** by understanding the limiting behavior of sequences that would otherwise "escape" compactness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications: **Nonlinear PDEs, critical Sobolev exponents, blow-up analysis**.</p>
