  <p><strong>(a)</strong> Right-hand continuity:
  \[
  \forall \varepsilon > 0 \; \exists \delta > 0 \text{ s.t. }
  0 < x - x_0 < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon,
  \quad x \to x_0^+.
  \]

  <p><strong>(b)</strong> Left-hand continuity:
  \[
  \forall \varepsilon > 0 \; \exists \delta > 0 \text{ s.t. }
  0 < x_0 - x < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon,
  \quad x \to x_0^-.

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(b) Function space.</strong><br>

</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>

  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Function set:</strong> Any set of functions, e.g., \( \{f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\} \).</p>

  <p><strong>(b) Function space:</strong> A set of functions with properties, e.g., the set of continuous functions \( C([a,b]) \) or integrable functions \( L^1([a,b]) \).</p>

  <p><strong>(c) Vector space:</strong> A set of vectors with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying the vector space axioms.</p>

  <p><strong>(d) Functions as vectors:</strong> Yes, functions can be considered vectors if defined so, because the elements only need to satisfy the vector space operations (addition and scalar multiplication) and axioms.</p>

<h2>Question 5: Proper functions, well-defined functions, and arbitrary assignments</h2>

<p>
<strong>Proper function:</strong><br>
A proper function \( f: X \to Y \) assigns exactly one element of \( Y \) to each element of the domain \( X \). It can be one-to-one or many-to-one. <strong>Note:</strong> a proper function might not be well-defined if the rule is ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
Explain the following concepts in your own words:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(a) Arbitrary assignment.</strong><br>
What is an arbitrary assignment?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(b) Well-defined function.</strong><br>
Explain what it means for a function to be well-defined.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(c) Why must every element of the domain have an image in a well-defined function?</strong>
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your reasoning here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>Proper function:</strong>  A proper function \( f: X \to Y \) is a relation from \( X \) to \( Y \) such that
  \[
  \forall x \in X, \exists! \, y \in Y \text{ s.t. } (x, y) \in f
  \]
  (i.e., each input has exactly one output). It can be one-to-one or many-to-one. 
  Note: a proper function might still be <strong>ambiguous</strong> if the rule defining it is inconsistent.</p>


  <p><strong>(a) Arbitrary assignment:</strong> An arbitrary assignment assigns outputs to elements of a set without necessarily obeying the rules of a well-defined function. It can be one-to-one, many-to-one, or leave some domain elements without outputs, but it cannot assign multiple outputs to the same input (one-to-many) if it were to be a proper function.</p>

  <p><strong>(b) Well-defined function:</strong> A function \( f: X \to Y \) is well-defined if
\[
\forall x \in X, \ f(x) \text{ is uniquely determined and belongs to } Y.
\]
Ambiguity occurs if there exists any \( x \in X \) for which \( f(x) \) is not uniquely determined.  
<strong>Observation:</strong> <em>Being ambiguous is logically equivalent to being not well-defined</em>.
</p>
  <p><strong>(c) Why every domain element must have an image:</strong> If any domain element had no image, the assignment would be incomplete or ambiguous. A well-defined function must assign exactly one output to each domain element.</p>

</details>

<h2>Question 6: Correspondence, equivalence, and equality of functions</h2>

<p>
Explain the following concepts in your own words and give examples if possible:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(a) Correspondence.</strong><br>
Define what it means for a function to be viewed as a correspondence.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(b) Equivalence of functions.</strong><br>
Define when two functions are considered equivalent. How does this relate to everyday use of the word “equivalent”?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>(c) Equality of functions.</strong><br>
Define when two functions are equal. How is this related to equivalence?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Correspondence:</strong><br>
  A correspondence is a set of ordered pairs \( (x, y) \) with \( x \in X \) and \( y \in Y \).  
  A function can be rigorously viewed as a correspondence in which each input \( x \in X \) appears in exactly one pair.  
  This formalizes the input-output relationship without necessarily specifying a formula or rule.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(b) Equivalence of functions:</strong><br>
  Two functions \( f, g: X \to Y \) are considered equivalent if
  \[
  \forall x \in X, \ f(x) = g(x).
  \]
  - This is the **mathematical definition**: outputs match for all inputs.  
  - In everyday language, “equivalent” can just mean “similar” or “interchangeable,” but in math it is **strict and precise**.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(c) Equality of functions:</strong><br>
  Two functions \( f, g: X \to Y \) are equal if their **correspondences (sets of ordered pairs) are identical**:
  \[
  f = g \quad \iff \quad \forall x \in X, \ f(x) = g(x).
  \]  
  Notice: for functions, **equality coincides with mathematical equivalence**, but equality emphasizes the set-of-pairs perspective.
  </p>

<h2>Question 7: Topology and Metrisability</h2>

<p>
Suppose we have elements in a vector space or a function space.  
<strong>Question (a):</strong> Why do we impose a topology on these elements?
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Question (b):</strong> Define metrizable (metrisiable) rigorously.
</p>

<textarea rows="3" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) Why impose a topology?</strong><br>
  We impose a topology on elements of vector or function spaces to define notions of **closeness, limits, continuity, and convergence**.  
  Topology formalises which elements are "near" each other without necessarily using numbers.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(b) Definition of metrisable space:</strong><br>
  A topological space \( (X, \mathcal{T}) \) is <strong>metrizable</strong> if there exists a metric \( d: X \times X \to [0, \infty) \) such that the topology induced by \( d \) is exactly \( \mathcal{T} \).  
  Formally:
  \[
  \mathcal{T} = \{ U \subseteq X \mid \forall x \in U, \exists \varepsilon > 0 \text{ s.t. } B_d(x, \varepsilon) \subseteq U \},
  \]
  where \( B_d(x, \varepsilon) = \{ y \in X \mid d(x, y) < \varepsilon \} \) is the open ball of radius \( \varepsilon \) around \( x \).  
  In words: a space is metrisable if we can assign a distance function such that "closeness" and "open sets" in the topology are exactly described by that metric.
  </p>

<h3>Key Point: Vectors as functions</h3>

<p>
If an element is both a vector and a function, we can describe a **finite vector** in \( \mathbb{R}^n \), say \((y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n)\), as a function
\[
f: \{1, 2, \dots, n\} \to \mathbb{R}
\]
where \( f(i) = y_i \). This gives the list of components that form the vector.  
</p>

<p>
For finite vectors, this function viewpoint is **possible but not necessary**.  
For **infinite-dimensional vectors**, the domain (index set) is infinite, e.g., \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \), and so the **function understanding becomes essential** for analysis.
</p>

<p>
This concept explains why function-based perspectives are fundamental in functional analysis, especially for infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>













<hr>

<h2>Key Point: Sequences, infinite-dimensional vectors, and functional perspective</h2>

<p>
A <strong>sequence</strong> is an infinite list of elements indexed by the natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \).  
Even if the outputs are simple, like \(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, \dots\), there are infinitely many values.  
</p>

<p>
A sequence can describe an <strong>infinite-dimensional vector</strong>, where each element of the sequence corresponds to a component of the vector.  
</p>

<p>
The <strong>sequence space</strong> is the set of different sequences. Each sequence is infinite and describes a single vector.  
</p>

<p>
To construct an infinite-dimensional vector, we need an infinite set of basis components.  
- If we have a vector that is "one-to-one," only one basis vector is needed to describe that vector.  
- To describe all vectors in an infinite-dimensional vector space, we require **infinitely many basis vectors**.  
</p>

<p>
Remember: these vectors can also be viewed as **functions**, where the domain is the index set (natural numbers) and the output is the component value. This is why **functional understanding is essential** in infinite-dimensional vector spaces.
</p>

















<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Norms, metrics, and infinite-dimensional vectors/functions</h3>

<p>
In finite-dimensional vector spaces, we often talk about **weights, lengths, distances, and angles** between vectors. In many manifolds or abstract spaces, we want the same: to measure **distances and angles** between vectors or functions.  
</p>

<p>
A <strong>norm</strong> is a function that assigns a size (length) to each vector or function:
\[
\|\cdot\| : V \to [0, \infty)
\]
and satisfies positive definiteness, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality.  
</p>

<p>
A norm induces a <strong>metric</strong> via
\[
d(u,v) = \|u-v\|.
\]
This metric tells us the "distance" between any two elements.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why not just define a metric directly?</strong><br>
- A metric measures distances, but does not automatically give you **lengths, scaling, or angles**.  
- A norm gives **more structure**: it tells you both the size of individual elements and induces a metric for distances.  
- Especially in infinite-dimensional spaces (e.g., sequences, function spaces), using a norm allows you to talk rigorously about:
  <ul>
    <li>Distances between elements</li>
    <li>Cauchy sequences and convergence</li>
    <li>Completeness of the space</li>
    <li>Linear structure (scaling and addition of vectors/functions)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
So, the norm is more than just a metric: it preserves the **linear and functional structure** of the space while giving a natural metric to define limits, convergence, and continuity.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Key distinction:</strong><br>
- In **functional analysis / infinite-dimensional vector spaces**, we use norms because we need both **linear structure and distance**.  
- In **general relativity / manifolds**, the space is **not a vector space**, so we only need a **metric tensor** to measure distances and angles; a separate norm is unnecessary.  
</p>













<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Closed subspaces and Cauchy sequences</h3>

<p>
A subset \(M \subset V\) of a normed space \(V\) is <strong>closed</strong> if it contains all its limit points:
\[
\text{If } (x_n) \subset M \text{ and } x_n \to x \text{ in } V, \text{ then } x \in M.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why closedness matters:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In infinite-dimensional spaces, the <strong>image of a linear map</strong> may not be closed, even if the map is linear and bounded.</li>
  <li>If the image is not closed, a **Cauchy sequence in the image may converge to a limit outside the image**, breaking convergence within the subspace.</li>
  <li>Closedness ensures that **limits of Cauchy sequences stay in the subspace**, which is essential for completeness and functional analysis constructions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Closedness = all limit points included. Necessary so that Cauchy sequences in a subspace converge **inside** the subspace, especially in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>









<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Completeness, norms, and convergence in normed spaces</h3>

<p>
A normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) is <strong>complete</strong> if <strong>every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a limit in the space</strong>.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Norm and distance:</strong><br>
- A norm assigns a size (length, or "weight") to each element, even if the element is an infinite-dimensional vector or a function.  
- The norm induces a metric:
\[
d(u,v) = \|u-v\|,
\]
which allows us to measure the distance between elements in a precise way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cauchy sequences:</strong><br>
- A Cauchy sequence \((v_n)\) satisfies:
\[
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ s.t. } \|v_n - v_m\| < \varepsilon \quad \forall n,m \ge N
\]
- Not every sequence is Cauchy, but in a **complete normed space**, every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit within the space.  
- The norm ensures that the "size" of differences between sequence elements is measurable, so we can meaningfully talk about convergence, even for infinite-dimensional elements.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important note on finiteness:</strong><br>
- The norm gives the "weight" of an element, but it does <em>not</em> guarantee the space is bounded; elements can have arbitrarily large norm.  
- What matters for convergence is that the sequence is Cauchy — distances between elements shrink — not that individual elements have finite norm.
</p>









<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Complete normed spaces (Banach spaces)</h3>

<p>
A <strong>complete normed space</strong>, also called a <strong>Banach space</strong>, is a normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) in which <strong>every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit within the space</strong>.
</p>

<p>
- The norm defines weights of each element and then the distances between elements: \(d(u,v) = \|u-v\|\).  
- Cauchy sequences are sequences whose elements get arbitrarily close.  
- Completeness ensures that these sequences have limits that stay in the space, making convergence meaningful even for infinite-dimensional elements.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Complete normed space = “all Cauchy sequences converge inside the space.”
</p>










<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Inner product and Hilbert spaces</h3>

<p>
- A <strong>norm</strong> gives the size (length) of vectors/functions, but it does not define angles.  
- To define **angles, orthogonality, and projections**, we use an <strong>inner product</strong>:
\[
\langle u, v \rangle
\]  
which satisfies linearity, symmetry (or conjugate symmetry), and positive-definiteness.
</p>

<p>
- A **Hilbert space** is a complete normed space in which the norm is induced by an inner product:
\[
\|v\| = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle}.
\]
- This allows us to rigorously define **lengths, angles, orthogonality, and projections** in infinite-dimensional spaces.
A manifold is able to define the weight of a vector, and distances and angles between other vectors, solely using the metric. For infinite-dimensional spaces, we use the norm and inner product.
</p>




<h2>Question 9: Projection onto a subspace</h2>

<p>
Define the projection of a vector or function onto a subspace. Give the key properties and intuition.
</p>

<textarea rows="4" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong> The <strong>projection</strong> of a vector or function \(x\) onto a subspace \(M\) is the element \(y \in M\) such that the difference \(x - y\) is orthogonal to \(M\).  
  </p>

  <p>
  Formally, let \(H\) be a Hilbert space and \(M \subset H\) a subspace. For every \(x \in H\), the projection of \(x\) onto \(M\) is the unique \(y \in M\) such that:
  \[
  x - y \perp M
  \]
  That is, \(\langle x - y, z \rangle = 0\) for all \(z \in M\).
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Intuition:</strong> \(y\) is the closest point in \(M\) to \(x\), so the projection “drops” \(x\) onto the subspace along the shortest path.
  </p>
</details>










<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Banach function spaces</h3>

<p>
A <strong>Banach function space</strong> is a function space that is also a <strong>complete normed space</strong>. That is, it consists of functions with certain properties, equipped with a norm, such that every Cauchy sequence of functions converges to a function in the space.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>C([a,b])</strong>: the space of all continuous functions on the interval [a,b], with the supremum norm \(\|f\|_\infty = \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)|\).</li>
  <li><strong>L<sup>p</sup>([a,b])</strong>: the space of Lebesgue p-integrable functions \(f\) such that
    \(\int_a^b |f(x)|^p dx < \infty\), with norm \(\|f\|_p = \left(\int_a^b |f(x)|^p dx\right)^{1/p}\).</li>
  <li><strong>l<sup>p</sup></strong>: the space of sequences \((y_1, y_2, \dots)\) such that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty |y_n|^p < \infty\). These sequences often represent the outputs of functions in a discretized sense.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Banach function spaces combine **function-specific properties** (like continuity or integrability) with **completeness under a norm**, allowing rigorous analysis of convergence and limits in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>










<h2>Question 10: Lebesgue function spaces L<sup>p</sup>(Ω)</h2>

<p>
Define the space L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) and explain the role of p and Ω. Discuss why infinite independent functions exist in this space and how indicator functions illustrate linear independence.
</p>

<textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  The Lebesgue space L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) consists of all functions \(f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)) such that
  \[
  \int_\Omega |f(x)|^p dx < \infty.
  \]
  Here:
  <ul>
    <li>\(\Omega\) is the domain of the functions (can be an interval, a measure space, or more abstract set).</li>
    <li>p ≥ 1 indicates the exponent in the integrability condition (controls how "strongly" the function is integrable).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Infinite independent functions:</strong><br>
  - L<sup>p</sup>(Ω) contains infinitely many linearly independent functions; no finite combination of functions can generate all of L<sup>p</sup>(Ω).  
  - A standard example: the <strong>indicator functions</strong> \(1_{A_i}\) of disjoint measurable subsets \(A_i \subset \Omega\).  
  - If \(A_i\) are disjoint, the functions \(1_{A_i}\) are linearly independent, because any linear combination is zero only if all coefficients are zero.  
  - Checking linear independence often relies on overlapping or disjoint sets to see if any combination produces zero everywhere.
  </p>
</details>
















<h2>Question 11: Linear maps, kernel, and image</h2>

<p>
Let \(T: V \to W\) be a linear map between vector spaces. Define the kernel and image of \(T\), and explain the relationship to injectivity and surjectivity. Discuss any special considerations for infinite-dimensional spaces.
</p>

<textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>

  <p>
  <strong>Definition of linear map:</strong><br>
  \(T: V \to W\) is linear if
  \[
  T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y), \quad T(\alpha x) = \alpha T(x), \quad \forall x,y \in V, \ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \text{ or } \mathbb{C}.
  \]
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Kernel:</strong><br>
  The kernel of \(T\) is
  \[
  \ker(T) = \{x \in V : T(x) = 0\}.
  \]
  <strong>Injectivity:</strong> \(T\) is injective if and only if \(\ker(T) = \{0\}\).
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Image (range):</strong><br>
  The image of \(T\) is
  \[
  \operatorname{im}(T) = \{T(x) : x \in V\} \subset W.
  \]
  <strong>Surjectivity:</strong> \(T\) is surjective if \(\operatorname{im}(T) = W\).  
  - In infinite-dimensional spaces, the image may **not be closed**, so surjectivity is harder to check.  
  - Continuity (or boundedness) of \(T\) is often necessary to guarantee nice properties of the image.
  </p>
</details>






<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Dual Space V*</h3>

<p>
The <strong>dual space</strong> of a vector space \(V\) over a field \(\mathbb{F}\) is the set of all <strong>linear functionals</strong> from \(V\) to \(\mathbb{F}\):
\[
V^* = \{ f : V \to \mathbb{F} \mid f \text{ is linear} \}.
\]
</p>

<p>
A <strong>linear functional</strong> \(f\) satisfies, for all \(x, y \in V\) and \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F}\):
\[
f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), \quad f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x).
\]
</p>

<p>
The dual space \(V^*\) itself is a vector space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication:
\[
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), \quad (\alpha f)(x) = \alpha f(x), \quad \forall x \in V.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Intuition:</strong> Each element of \(V^*\) “measures” vectors in \(V\) by assigning a scalar. The dual space collects all such linear measurements, providing a powerful tool in functional analysis for understanding the structure of \(V\).

  <p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
  The <strong>dual space</strong> of a vector space \(V\) over a field \(\mathbb{F}\) is
  \[
  V^* = \{ f : V \to \mathbb{F} \mid f \text{ is linear} \}.
  \]
  Elements of \(V^*\) are called <strong>linear functionals</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Infinite-dimensional case:</strong><br>
  - If \(V\) is infinite-dimensional, there exist **more linear functionals than vectors in \(V\)**.  
  - Intuition / sketch of proof:  
    1. Let \(\{e_1, e_2, \dots\}\) be a basis for \(V\).  
    2. Any sequence \((a_1, a_2, \dots)\) of scalars defines a linear functional \(f\) by
       \[
       f\Big(\sum_i x_i e_i\Big) = \sum_i a_i x_i
       \]
       which is well-defined if only finitely many \(x_i\) are nonzero (Hamel basis).  
    3. There are infinitely many choices of sequences \((a_1, a_2, \dots)\), so **dim \(V^* >\) dim \(V\)**.  
  - In contrast, in finite-dimensional spaces, \(\dim V^* = \dim V\).

<h3>Key Point: Topological Space</h3>

<p>
A <strong>topological space</strong> is a pair \((X, \tau)\) where:
<ul>
  <li>\(X\) is a set (the underlying space).</li>
  <li>\(\tau\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) called <strong>open sets</strong>, satisfying the following axioms:</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The empty set and the whole set are open: 
  \(\emptyset \in \tau\) and \(X \in \tau\).</li>
  <li>Arbitrary unions of open sets are open: 
  \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha \in \tau\) for any collection \(\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} \subset \tau\).</li>
  <li>Finite intersections of open sets are open: 
  \(\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau\) for any finite collection \(U_1, \dots, U_n \in \tau\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A topological space \((X, \tau)\) gives a notion of "openness" on \(X\), allowing us to define concepts like **continuity, convergence, connectedness, and compactness** in a general setting.
</p>




<hr>

<h3>Key Point: Metric Space</h3>

<p>
A <strong>metric space</strong> is a pair \((X, d)\) where:
<ul>
  <li>\(X\) is a set (the space of points or elements).</li>
  <li>\(d: X \times X \to [0, \infty)\) is a function called a <strong>metric</strong> or distance, satisfying the following axioms for all \(x, y, z \in X\):</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> \(d(x,y) \ge 0\), and \(d(x,y) = 0\) if and only if \(x = y\).</li>
  <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> \(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\).</li>
  <li><strong>Triangle inequality:</strong> \(d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Example: Normed spaces</strong><br>
A normed space \((V, \|\cdot\|)\) is also a metric space with
\[
d(x,y) = \|x - y\|.
\]
This metric induces the topology of the space via open balls:
\[
B(x, r) = \{y \in V : \|x - y\| < r\}.
\]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Metric spaces formalise the concept of distance, allowing definitions of **convergence, Cauchy sequences, continuity, and compactness** in a general setting. Norms automatically give a metric, but a metric does not necessarily come from a norm.
In Banach spaces, a metric is induced by the norm \[
d(x,y) = \|x - y\|.
\]. This does not necessarily define the angles yet for Banach - inner product needed.

<h3>Key Point: Compactness and the unit ball in infinite-dimensional normed spaces</h3>

<p>
<strong>Compactness:</strong><br>
A subset \(K\) of a normed space \(V\) is <strong>compact</strong> if every sequence \((x_n) \subset K\) has a subsequence that converges to an element in \(K\) 
(<em>sequential compactness</em>).  
Equivalently, in topological terms, \(K\) is compact if **every open cover of \(K\) has a finite subcover**: for any collection of open sets \(\mathcal{U}\) with
\(\displaystyle K \subseteq \bigcup_{U \in \mathcal{U}} U\), there exists a finite subcollection \(U_1, \dots, U_n \in \mathcal{U}\) such that
\(\displaystyle K \subseteq U_1 \cup \dots \cup U_n\).
</p>



<p>
<strong>Important fact in infinite-dimensional spaces:</strong><br>
- Unlike finite-dimensional spaces, in infinite-dimensional normed spaces, a set being <strong>closed and bounded</strong> does <strong>not</strong> guarantee compactness.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Unit ball:</strong><br>
- The <strong>unit ball</strong) in a normed space \(V\) is defined as
\[
B = \{ x \in V : \|x\| \le 1 \}.
\]  
- It consists of all vectors/functions with norm ≤ 1.  
- <strong>Key point:</strong> In infinite-dimensional spaces, the unit ball is never compact.  
  - Intuition: You can always construct a sequence in the unit ball (e.g., basis vectors) with no convergent subsequence, so it fails the sequential compactness criterion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong>  
- Compact = every sequence has a convergent subsequence within the set.  
- Closed + bounded ≠ compact in infinite dimensions.  
- Unit ball is a simple example of a bounded, closed set that is **never compact**.
</p>

<h3>Key Point: Connectedness and countability in infinite-dimensional normed spaces</h3>

<p>
<strong>Connectedness:</strong><br>
A topological space \(X\) is <strong>connected</strong> if it cannot be represented as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets.  
Equivalently, there are no two nonempty open sets \(U, V \subset X\) such that \(X = U \cup V\) and \(U \cap V = \emptyset\).  
</p>

<p>
In normed spaces (including infinite-dimensional ones), connectedness often comes from **path-connectedness**: any two points \(x, y \in X\) can be joined by a continuous path \(\gamma: [0,1] \to X\) with \(\gamma(0) = x, \gamma(1) = y\).  
- Infinite-dimensional normed spaces are typically **connected** and **path-connected**.
</p>

<p>
<strong>First-countable (1st ctb):</strong><br>
A topological space \(X\) is <strong>first-countable</strong> if each point \(x \in X\) has a **countable local base** of neighborhoods.  
- In normed spaces, the open balls \(B(x, 1/n)\), \(n = 1, 2, \dots\), form a countable local base, so **all normed spaces are first-countable**.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Second-countable (2nd ctb):</strong><br>
A space is <strong>second-countable</strong> if there exists a **countable base for the entire topology**.  
- Finite-dimensional normed spaces (like \(\mathbb{R}^n\)) are second-countable.  
- Infinite-dimensional normed spaces are generally **not second-countable**, because any base for the topology of open balls must be uncountable.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
- Connected = cannot split into two nonempty disjoint open sets.  
- Path-connected = any two points joined by a continuous path; implies connectedness.  
- 1st ctb = countable local base at each point → holds in all normed spaces.  
- 2nd ctb = countable base for the whole topology → fails in infinite-dimensional spaces.

<h3>Key Point: Product and Quotient Topologies</h3>

<p>
<strong>1. Product Topology:</strong><br>
Let \(\{X_i\}_{i \in I}\) be a family of topological spaces with topologies \(\tau_i\).  
The <strong>product space</strong> is 
\[
X = \prod_{i \in I} X_i = \{ (x_i)_{i \in I} : x_i \in X_i \}.
\]  
The <strong>product topology</strong> on \(X\) is the coarsest (smallest) topology that makes all projection maps
\(\pi_j : X \to X_j\), \(\pi_j((x_i)_{i \in I}) = x_j\), continuous.  

<ul>
  <li>Basis elements: finite intersections of sets of the form \(\pi_j^{-1}(U_j)\), where \(U_j \subset X_j\) is open.</li>
  <li>Intuition: Open sets in the product correspond to “all but finitely many coordinates unrestricted, finitely many coordinates constrained.”</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> \(\mathbb{R}^n = \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbb{R}\) with the usual topology is a product topology of \(n\) copies of \(\mathbb{R}\). Infinite products (e.g., sequences) use the same idea but with infinitely many coordinates.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>2. Quotient Topology:</strong><br>
Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\tau\), and let \(\sim\) be an equivalence relation on \(X\).  
The set of equivalence classes is 
\[
X / \sim = \{ [x] : x \in X \}.
\]  
The <strong>quotient topology</strong> on \(X / \sim\) is defined as the finest topology that makes the canonical projection
\(\pi: X \to X / \sim, \ \pi(x) = [x]\)
continuous.  

<ul>
  <li>Open sets in \(X / \sim\) are exactly the subsets \(U \subset X / \sim\) for which \(\pi^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(X\).</li>
  <li>Intuition: The quotient topology “inherits” openness from \(X\) via the projection map.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> Identify opposite edges of a square to form a torus. The quotient topology ensures that neighborhoods on the edges “glue together” properly.
</p>

<h3>Question 11: Symbols in equivalence and logic</h3>

<p>
Explain what the following symbols mean in mathematics, especially in the context of equivalence, definitions, and topology:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(a) ~</strong><br>
<textarea rows="2" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>
</p>

<p>
<strong>(b) ≡</strong><br>

<p>
<strong>(c) ⇔</strong><br>
<textarea rows="2" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here"></textarea>
</p>

<hr>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solutions</strong></summary>

  <p><strong>(a) ~</strong><br>
  Denotes a general <strong>equivalence relation</strong> between elements.  
  Example: \(x \sim y\) means “x is equivalent to y under some defined rule.”  
  Used in quotient topology to define equivalence classes \([x] = \{y \in X : y \sim x\}\).</p>

  <p><strong>(b) ≡</strong><br>
  The triple line can mean several context-dependent things:  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identity / definition:</strong> \(f(x) \equiv x^2\) means “f(x) is defined to be x² for all x.”</li>
    <li><strong>Congruence modulo n:</strong> \(7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}\).</li>
    <li><strong>Logical equivalence:</strong> \(P \equiv Q\) in logic.</li>
  </ul>
  Note: It is not used as a general equivalence relation for quotient topology; \(\sim\) is used for that instead.</p>

  <p><strong>(c) ⇔</strong><br>
  A <strong>logical connective</strong> meaning “if and only if.”  
  Example: \(x \in A \Leftrightarrow x > 0\).  
  This is used between statements, not between elements, so it is not for defining equivalence classes.</p>
